      "so it is my pleasure to welcome you to the IPS NAD lecture series by Mr Philip yo our 16 Sr NAD fellow for the study of Singapore today Mr y will be delivering his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation following his lecture Mr yo will take questions from the audience in the Q&A session the Q&A session will be checked by Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information development at the ministry of digital development and information before we begin please allow me to go over some housekeeping rules for the event thank you for joining us today at the auditorium please be reminded to switch your mobile phones to silent mode the lectur is being streamed live on Facebook it will also be recorded and uploaded onto our IPS website and our social media platforms later please subm me your comments and questions at anytime during the lecture through the Facebook comments for audience members here at auditorium today please step up to the mic during the Q&A session to ask your questions we also like to hear your views on the event there will be a link in the feed at the end of the lecture and a QR code which you can scan to submit your feedback director of ips janit deavon will now deliver his opening remarks director [Applause] please welcome everyone Philip yo our Sr norn fellow for this year is s generis that's Latin for Philip you're one kind one and I can do that's very difficult to introduce him so I will tell two stories which I heard from him first many years ago he may not remember the stor the stories are not exactly about him but about his mentor and Guru uh Dr goking s but it tells you a lot about him the first is a story uh both stories involved I think when you were in minda with him in the early years director what was it planning uh I can't remember what it was but anyway um one day at that time um we had pig farms in Singapore and the pig farms were causing u a lot of problems singaporeans were also complainers then and people complained about the smell of pigs but they also wanted to eat pork um and so how to solve this problem so Dr go calls Philip yo at then what 25 years old something like that uh very young man and calls him in and says look I've had an idea why do we get one of these disused super tankers you know buy them cheap put all the pics on the super tankers and sail the boat the ship out to South China Sea so he asked Philip yo to go and research this idea so Philip yo did and a few days later came back and says uh Dr go pigs don't sweat which is why they roll around in the mug you put them on a super tanker in the middle of the ocean they will all die of heat stroke you will have chasu but not pigs so that was the end of that idea another idea Dr go he reads in some magazine about Krill and how Krill contains very high protein and this story calls up again Philip and says there's this story Krill is very cheap actually the fishermen when they catch the Krill when uh they they throw the Krill away so why don't you go and collect all the Krill free of charge we don't have to pay and then we use it to feed the Army which this time around Philip didn't do sufficient research he did as he was told caught the grill and then we ended up and I remember this because I was in the Army at that time this was early' 70s Dr had just come back to defense from Ministry of Finance we had Crill for breakfast Crill for lunch Crill for dinner at the end of one month Phillip went to doct go and says enough you're going to have a revolt on your hands so that was the end of krill I tell these stories because they illustrate like no other story I've heard how our founding fathers were cranks and there is a definition of genius I can't remember who it was who defined genius as that zigzag flash of lightning in the brain and there is nobody who illustrated that more in the political leadership than Dr go um and nobody in the Civil Service who illustrated that more than Philip yo zigzag flash of lightning in the brain not all cranky ideas are accurate or good so you actually need the philipo in the first guys to go and tell the politician sir you're going to get Chu not pigs second idea you also need somebody like Philip yo to try out cranky ideas so this weird combination of the ability to speak truth to power and also willingness to try out crazy things is what produce the Singapore of today right you if you can't if you if you only have people who take the safe way the predictable way we wouldn't have got the Singapore of today now I have not read the remarks that were prepared for me because it's very difficult to capture philipo unless you've known him or worked with him neither of which I've done but certainly I'm old enough to remember the Philip yo who played such a huge seminal role um in the development of Singapore I won't summarize what he has to say um uh except uh to say that um you will hear plenty of evidence of the zigzag flash of lightning that's genius so without Much Ado please Philip thank you so much director ladies and gentlemen without further Ado I would like to invite Mr Philip yo to begin his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation Mr yo [Applause] please okay let me put out the first slide this slide is important for Singapore and is also for me from 1960 to 65 I was happy in HGI in the library in 6 1966 I went off to Toronto I came back in 70 as an Industrial Engineer so my whole career started from 1970 when I spent my first job other shot one man with finan was Ministry of Defense so I've been working with Ministry defense from 1970 which the same time as skill intensive 1970 to 1994 most people don't know that I was my payroll even was EDB was still in defense from 19 but i mov from EDB 86 1984 and I was always say what's important is that during my 1970 to 94 although was also evv all my work was industry defense industry I produced motor bombs M16 anti aircraft ammunition build warships rebuilt the Skyhawks so all my career has always been industry so very naturally when Singapore got in trouble at an EDB and EDB are continue the same uh economic role you can see the curve they we have to move to more and more uh particular Industries so in a sense if I look at my this calendar here this chart here is from 1970 to 2006 it's always economic so let me go to the next one the faces I think most sing is aware actually we took off only in 1970 the British left Singapore in 19697 and my first job in defense was to create jobs for Singapore is retrenched by the British Army and that's how I end up building up a defense industry to create jobs for sing for so next phase was Capital intensive for which is important that we have to go into more and more uh labor constraint for unemployment to almost full employment by the 1980s and technology which are continue so my whole career is from the 70s to the 1990s to 2000 now where we are today everybody knows that so I won't emphasize on that now this is important chart when I took over EDB 86 I was a b member of Ed 82 to 85 I was a pump sa in defense I was also chairman computer board defense industry so I was there so I realized in EDB in 1986 how can we contribute the GDP of Singapore at that time uh we had about trying to aim for 25% share of GDP which a tough number and at least 20% of employment of Singapore must be industry but today you look at it employment of singap in Industry today is about 12% 15% but our allp put is HS higher our manufacturing sector is hard to keep at 25 because labor constraints to really look at Singapore 15% of our employees of singapor are working for Industries to produce 20% of GDP it's very significant very few singapor are add that most of our industries that are manufacturing are export there is no local market it 85% of economy is Services which is domestic maybe for Logistics or Ship Repair shipping most of industries that we have sample is that we have less than 15% of population in manufacturing we producing 19% to close to 20 depend on the year of the GDP what's interesting to look at the numbers I ask for breakdown Electronics multinational chemicals multinational bom medical multinational you look at the share of the value added very high I look at Precision Engineering transport G these are more local companies the value is low so from this two data you can see that the multinational companies contrib a very large percent of economic sector and also they give jobs to the local Precision Engineering and uh and bi medical General manufacturing so we need to that combination why do we push for manufacturing I remember I had a long dinner Mr with manufacturing I don't depend on my neighbors if I try to sell services to my neighbors they will never buy so what they have done is manufacturing ski for us to get out of Singapore and drct go play a very important part when I came back from Toronto in 1970 my first job was trying to escape the PSC chairman PSC here because they need offer me a job for one month I applied for a job with a company called L Industries L industry like Texas was one of the semiconductor companies that Singapore so my first job offer offer me as a engineer Industrial Engineer with industry the PSC say sorry you can't you go you're bonded so I stay on then I complain uh how about EDB uh you also cannot go because EDB is actually bought for two month so two job offers the industries rejected rejected how about going to the Ministry of Finance I end up in finance for one month after one my complain is not engineering job uh doing budget work oh they're looking for assist engineer and me they have so that's it so I been there all my own free will now what you can see in Singapore that we really mov when I first joined 1970 came back Singapore was making a magnetic CES any of here magnetic memory CS put a wire through that's how we did very low value but create a lot of jobs and Singapore create a lot of jobs so then we going to next so today we are down more balance unlike many countries around Singapore we are not dependent on one sector we we actually grown I explain the share Precision Engineering which makes a lot of key parts for the D drive electronics and semiconductor we still have a semiconductor industry which is important by the way I set up Charter industry chter Semiconductor in 87 and the same year as tsmc unfortunately tsmc at the full support of the government Singapore government says Liv to multinational that's what happened uh energy chemicals are there and you have the Aerospace Aerospace so if we look at Singapore we are more Diversified than Taiwan Taiwan is only one industry semiconductor we are more balanced fi and partly because unlike Taiwan most of the companies we have are multinational in Taiwan most the company are local if I remember years ago when I to Taiwan Taiwan has a tari of 30% Singapore no tari tyan has a sizer population we don't have so in a sense un like Taiwan uh we have to depend on multinational Investments That give us what Dr go call they bring us technology uh they bring us production know how and the most important is management and markets and Dr go is a very key person in in the defense in the economic of EDB uh when I was in uh in defense he was still involved in the defense industry was also created by Him to create jobs for singaporeans most of you are not aware I involved in amation tanks should produce the first cette for the Navy unit 87 uh rebuild a skyw so all this was because to create jobs we have gone through that phase now everybody knows this now our industry because of our population size we have to constantly upgrade there's no way for us to uh take on labor intensive jobs so you look at transformation that way now we have the done everything by multinational and uh in semiconductors we done it but the key industry we had in the early 70s was a semiconductor long before anybody appreciate long before besides own Ship Repair and as far concerned the semiconductor industry has given us very Brad P the same skills are here today we don't produce uh one particular company but we have many more companies here uh this is it we are in chip design We Are W for fabrication we produce all the this year we do assemble test now assemble test is the most labor intensive so we move when I was EDB help encourage them to move to Pang so you see a lot of the assem test in P actually from Singapore same the people there because we use pan as our more of the labor and we focus on upgrade so Singapore and pan has a very unique relationship unfortunately sing J doesn't have the same let me go on to here okay 1985 uh I was still defend froms so uh I was asked by Minister of Finance that time TR industry ton can you be a chairman of skill Development Fund so Al the problem so September 19985 when I still in defense I took a job job of chairman SK fund then I realized economy was really sinking so can you please come over it be halftime in defense halftime from January 86 I say well I try M I give up I just move over remain as a pump defense and ODP full-time in Jan 86 you look at the data here this are first recession remember manufa is a very key component in 1986 the employment is more than 20% of Singapore population at one time was more than 25 but to is gone down it was a big shock to us that's what I did now EDB has never advertised in the whole history from 1961 to 1986 so when I Tred to Market this advertisement with the Wall Street Financial Times the ministry of trade industry says sorry got no budget so I complained my Minister says no budet why not use some of your reserves so I had to dig with own pocket and run this advertisement and this advertisement I went around to see my good friends in America these are all wellknown companies some are still around and they sign off uh and this was the first time we realized we have how to promote Singapore because at that time one the kid problem on 85 recession was our share our cpf was 25% your contribution 25% by the company at 50% cpf you killed all the companies so 85 recession I always believe is self created self-inflicted anyway after a retire from EDB in 2010 some my fellow uh colleagues sign this off for me as my reputation are working anyway it's a joke now our recovery was good we push for more and more high value production especially trying to move away from uh low value added industry of Refinery the services sector we took on three new sector it sector business headquarters uh Medical Services I try to promote to and uh these were the services we try because in manufacturing I can automate I can produce higher productive in Services harder so my rule of time easier to upgrade manufacturing and to provide services unless the services of high value and next was how to diversify the regional market and those are thing let me take the chemical sector Singapore has been a refining Center over 100 years but the value added is very low we produce refined products for gasoline for kerosene that's it and we are selling these products to the region the low value add is very low so the key constraints was how do we uh at create more jobs the only way to create more jobs in the chemical sector is to go down down the Christmas tree go down to more and more products so came idea I I need to go down the petrochemical route I need land and land is not so easy available in Singapore in fact I went to look at Sosa Island and then the tourist was horrified they're going to steal the island by anyway Sosa island is too small but only 400 450 hectares not very big what I wanted was 3,000 hectares very ambitious because my idea if I I have 3,000 Hees I can have at least three petrochemical comp complex I can produce 3 million tons eth every petrochemical complex is one ethine million tons so minimum three but still four or five to create mass at the same time I want the chemic industry to be link to each other so one a produce something goes to B produce go to C so it's integr itself is is almost a full cluster rather than stand load and this idea was to create and most and secondly one on the island where nobody lives I went to Rotterdam I went to Houston I saw all the houses around them every now there's a fire so I said know the only way is to put in my Island so I asked the government for a budget of 7 billion they nearly fainted so usually I thought okay we start with 500 900 eventually today we have 3,200 hectares that's almost 8,000 acres of land is still available but the chemical entry is changing so now we have to look for what else can we do so I'm spending time with some my EDB colleagues what industries can we put in J Island besides the petrochemical complex now this is good example of anyway Skip One now this is how we refine uh you see refining is low value added now we are down to Specialty Chemicals Petr chemical is there so EDB collect are chasing special chemicals more high value lower volume with good prices and they dependent but at the same time what else what else can we do so the big challenge for Singapore is how to keep on moving ahead because the key challenge for us how to remain linked to the world to manufacturing not just service in the region so now we come to what we have now what most of you are not aware when I try to go down to Farmer production we have no land so I asked my EDB colleagues can we reclaim some more land so from near the shipyards in j where called the to area I asked them to help to reclaim and they reclaim about 300 280 hectares so all the farmer Industries all there and they allocated they share the same utility they same all the needs in the sense they already compact if you go to any farmer company in America us is one company here one company there all SC country here is all P to do today we produce eight of the top uh biological drugs in the world we don't own them uh we produce the drugs for all the companies we have no generics generics are India China Thailand we are all propi because the margins are high but it's a industry that we have packed together and we have trained people for the industry every time there's a new drop we hope they bring it to Singapore so today we have a good these are all the companies here all brand names unfortunately we don't have a local names uh these are all International names and these are names you do not see in Taiwan for sure right now in Hong Kong now and we continue to grow we have to continue grow because uh the biomedical industry biological Industries are very most of drugs are for cancer and other uh difficult diseases but on the other hand the value is very high every time there's a new drug we try to bring them to Singapore EDB colleagues and their job bring here why every drug has a patent life of 17 years the first seven years plus is clinical trial and there's no Revenue when the drug is approved by FDA the St is 10 years only so when I bring them to Singapore we give them the support in the tax holiday they got 10 years of pure cream beyond that somebody will do a generics harder to do with cancer drugs but that's it now all those things we have done most of the sing now I'm no longer EDB I spend my time needling them says are you worried so I thought my good I can ask uh Kong to come and worry us yeah Kong do serve as MDB and as you know EDB is is a place where we travel with one suit case you got five shirts and four trousers Monday to Friday no checking luggage you want check luggage you can join another Ministry yeah so our let me just put this way our operating environment has really changed we all read in the news we have a geopolitical we have trade tariffs the tariffs are going serious we might be CAU it tax incentives our tax incentives no longer be useful and just Big Challenge we have to modify but we are lucky we are in a region aan region I always tell my col it's important region that most of us better learn the speak besides manding Bahasa very young people don't understand that because our neighborhood is still uh lots of Malaysia Indonesia combined together can give us about only 300 million competition for talent the biggest challenge for Singapore last year we had only 35,000 babies I said so we need to go and kidnap and when I was Ed I specialize in kidnapping I take young kids from the region Vietnam India China bring them in young bring them young at 15 you can indoctrinate them they grow up to be singaporeans they bring over 21 they will not be singaporeans so if you really want to grow Singapore KET the best and brightest from the region free education Singapore from seary to jc2 then you got a new Singapore ready made right and ai ai is an area where I was just reading an article I sent to a k you know dips it sounds very simple what's happening now is not dpck they apply dips in every industry the key is not AI the key is how to use it depends on the industry whether I can use it in drug development I can use it in manufacturing I can use in banking so the key is that AI will possibly change the biggest difficulty was that AI I also change employment so employment is another area where I really can for example there a doct I say know when you go for X grade you got depend on the X-ray uh technici take a look but lot of the AI can do of the mundan work which means the demand for skill set will change the only industry that safe are medical services are still safe you a doctors you need nurses every other industry whether they accounting auditing all other Str now nobody knows how bad but it will be happening and these are the key risk so for every if I were the Singapore business Federation will be worrying these are the issue that we have to worry uh how are we going to because nobody knows Mr Trump has been Office foress 100 days already and we all in a spin uh last day I was watching the speech uh we call call reciprocal tariff if we put a t 10 % you put 10% so you going to change a LW you know America for example Mexico and Canada all exports to United States is tar free now he want slam 25% he just get a retrie for one month for the automative industry because automated is well integrated between Canada us and Mexico there a lot disruption uncertainty uh I think politically will be a challenge for young uh government because who knows uh where where we are going but key for us is Singapore Singapore has to be prepared we have to look at advantages of each of these sectors what else can we do so in a sense uh looking forward our EDB officers we have to start thinking how how do we navigate the changes now this is I emphasize to my colleagues uh I work a lot with Indonesia uh started B industrial state 1990 by 1992 was Full Employment I moved to Vietnam today Vietnam uh vsip was my project 94 now there are 18 parks in Vietnam by the same participation I started bang Park 1995 96 16 or know today we are in Bangalore chenai Hyderabad Pune and Bombay so I look at Vietnam we have our uh Mark there in India we have a mark indes a mark China is we have W and so we have to look at maybe we can take advantage position Singapore to take advantage of our neighborhood which means we must accept Singapore to get out of comfort of Singapore and go and manage companies there not just sit at home uh waiting for government vouchers now I mention about Talent this is important thing so I was studing uh in ch can you please go and kidnap because America is cutting the ni budget uh my son is a victim there normally for every dollar research you get another 30 cents for supporting a lab uh electricity water so ni cut down to 15% which means you I a professor I Let Go students and Lego it's quite difficulty for them wor they announc that they'll freeze all probation officers anyone in the US government who a probation means a fresh officer your job is gone it should be way you should Tak in the young ones maybe ret return some of the mid Med managers but that's the way it does so many our young PhD students today are job so if I were the Singapore government I go there and kidnap all of them yeah and they it deep s is not just an eight I it's the same way as we apply it throughout I remember when I set Singapore commun system in 1980s applying SCS computer science to all the manufacturing and those days I was using computers many computers in the same way deeps and the similar whether from Alibaba will have great impact on manufacturing and services so I hope our people are churning out I've just read article that China has more than three 300 colleges set up to train people in AI not all succeed but they produce and a day there will be a critical mask that will come up so maybe ask K to come and entertain us now [Applause] thank you so much uh Mr yo for your lecture for those watching the lecture on Facebook please submit your comments and questions through the Facebook comment box for audience members here please step up to the mic to ask your questions may I now invite Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information and development at the ministry of digital development and information to start the qna session thanks very much thanks Mr y uh I don't think we need the mics Okay so so uh as you can tell Mr y's style is very Breezy and quick and you know because I think he wants to get down to discussing and to having a great debate with you guys so before we start can I just ask set some house rules first I'll keep the questions short I know many people will be will want to make comments uh just make a short comment more importantly questions so that Mr yo can answer uh secondly we try to keep to the content of the speech really on economic strategy there's a lot more that you can ask him later but let's focus on economic strategy transformation and maybe his time at uh EDB uh I'm as as you would know know I had the honor of actually in a sense following in Mr y's footstep in EDB and one of the things I always remember is when I came in there was only one rule that uh was there throughout which is that trolley back rule uh everywhere you go you carry One Trolley back no matter where you go no matter whether it was a twoe trip no whether no matter whether you gone to Davos and you had a brave minus 20° C it was a One Trolley back Rule and we even maintained it to this day I don't know about DB now I imagine it's the case uh not because we no we are holding on to it because I think it's a symbol of what EDB stands for and what Singapore's economic transformation is about right we stay lean we stay mean we always hustling we always hungry and we always chasing and we got to move fast uh maybe you want to explain why is why did you Institute the one back trolley rule well I I will I arrive in New York on a Sunday arrest Monday morning I wake up early breakfast I leave a hotel one back because we are going to several cities if you want to check your luggage goodbye to your luggage because you change planes and then there delay so hang out to your luggage for dear life one lug so the ru is five shirts four pants B that's for guys now how about for women ladies Now ladies have to roll up their dresses and sausages because otherwise you know the ladies not smart they roll dresses and simple and always dress we only one coat there a coat you wear so for lady officers who Trav we have to learn the same way one now it sounds a bit cruel because I can wake up in New York and I go to uh B another Chicago I go to kooko to look at Del's equipment under the car then I fly to San Francisco so I get 26 27 hours Advantage mhm my working hour is 27 hours because I moved from New York by time I reach California 11:00 I actually have 27 so that's a way and the other key reason is that we have no time for laundry you do laundry you lose your laundry so you make sure you got five shirts four pants five underwear for sure and five socks yeah and the lady officer adjust to be fair oh my lady when I first join EDB 86 there only five lady officers surely CH a few of people but 50% of ladies so I think I'm better diversity than Mr Trump yeah we always say that the ladies in EDB are always uh one of a kind because they are the ones to volunteer for all the difficult assignments like like going to Mumbai going to you know China okay great so maybe let's launch off from where you ended because you know we are now in a new phase uh when you join EDB in manufacturing uh you know this you could argue that actually the you know the conditions were very rip for the manufacturing takeoff right uh globalization mnc's were expanding yeah in fact just a factoid for you right when the semic you know semiconductors are being talked about quite a bit right now actually the semiconductor industry was one of the first Industries to Offshore off offshore within less than 10 years 7 eight years from Silicon Valley they offsh short first place they offshot because it was too and you know Mr yo talked about the assembly and testing part of it which was really the low value connecting wires the first place they offshot was actually Hong Kong because back then American workers were paid $2.50 an hour Hong Kong 25 cent therea came Taiwan 19 cents yes and guess where Singapore was yeah third in theow third in line 11 cents and that's really how we started and today is a completely different story right if you think about it sure we are probably the most most expensive you compare Hong Kong doesn't really have a manufacturing industry but no Taiwan shenen of course right we are also land is very expensive but more critically now we have carbon as a constraint not plus you have tariffs you have a retreat from globalization you have even the prospect of us and China uh contest so do you still believe that manufacturing is the way to go and if so what are the areas that Singapore can comp sure well in semiconductor up to Mr Biden's time and Trump's recently Us lost all conductor other than Intel AMD for example I used to know them so their Foundry in Dr Germany to Global foundaries IBM in fish uh fish kill upate New York I used to visit them saw The waer Foundry also to Global foundaries who is global Foundry uh Abu Dhabi so Abu Dhabi MD uh mad asked me Mr you we want to put all these companies together in Singapore we also bu semiconductor your company to create Global foundies I said well if you buy Dron Singapore and fish New York and Singapore what's your plan we want to build a waer fat Foundry in Abu Dhabi obviously I kept quite a laugh see he never succeeded but I warn them that Global Foundry in this business you must continually invest you cannot stop so I joking teased the CEO mad I say semiconductor Foundry is having a fence mistress very expensive to maintain that's what happened you look at uh TSM every year he has to invest fur F from five Micron to four Micron treat so it's a very challenging so either you have the money or you have the skill if you don't have the skill for example uh tsmc set a factory in Now Phoenix Arizona they have to export 500 Taiwanese there engine and don't forget and semiconductor industry is a 24 by7 there's no such thing as a thank God is Thursday which is American culture yeah after the earthquake straight away the Taiwanese engineer went went to fix we visit a semiconductor plant in Taiwan s gone they even have doet trees nearby because you are working on Shi three Shi or four Shi you want to have t is Friday you cannot build manufacturing semiconductor and that's why I'm very optim pessimistic that America was suceed Intel is now for sale uh Brock C is looking at Intel and then Trump squee uh T can you please buy The Foundry of Intel so the company the biggest reason why Intel is in this back position because when Apple came out iPhone in 207 he used Motorola chips intel was not interested then Apple switch to a chip arm chips are one designed by British group there's no uh it phone that use Apple phone that uses Intel chips they stuck at PCS and desktop computer so Intel lost it the key fit of future key fit for Intel failing was 207 they didn't want to produce the chip for the phone was the biggest mistake I thought is small value today in everything that we have in the car electric car your home vir is semiconductor semiconductor is more available to us today than anything else you look at electric car the key is a battery is chemistry the battery is a DC so when you charge the car you must charge DC when the car will have to convert from DC to AC to control the the induction motor that control the wheel the semiconductor chip the energy management is semiconductor that's it so lucky or not semiconductor today so perect so Americans now realize the so every country now in the world are trying to have the old own National semiconductor Japan is trying to do the same so in Singapore as far we concerned if we can find our Niche we can stay that it but we need good Engineers a good engineer we train we need to have I remember when 19 when I got Su to be at my empty I bought him back from New York and I say I want to build 25 wer F he nearly fainted why 25 W for f needs a lot of water electricity is one water water has no substitute electricity I can use diesel can petrol and what have you or wind so 25 wer fat require lots of water so s say yeah we cannot talk to Pub they will never agree so we came up Idea new water new water is actually edb's idea if I cannot get water I have to recycle although s promote you can drink it but don't drink it well the Recycled water is pure no impurities you one more water so that is important for deionized water and semiconductor so energy intensive water intensive so that's why in Singapore now we have a sizable semiconductor we are now B uh number three and we produce a lot of common parts that goes to everywhere most of our chips now go to Automotive EV so most singapor don't know that all the chips that we produce are really we don't do SML test all ship it out we do the components it goes up we have the we do the casting we do the shape the design and then it goes up but the thing that most Singapore don't see a because it's all in jurong they only know AER Road they know uh so Singapore do not know that out in j under DTC that's where the export of Singapore is that's where the job is and don't forget the multinationals make a lot of money they keep the money in Singapore Banks that's something but not that's why the doctor created the US dollar because all the mountain at one time G motor was here I remember they oh Mr we have about 500 million dollar Us in Singapore why Singapore is safe place they make their money get tax H they keep their money here everybody is happy yeah but you know so that's really I mean kudos to you and the team right you've really created some engines of growth right you have Electronics you have chemicals and bio Biomat but if you you know if I when I was at EDB if I get a penny for every time someone ask me so what's the industry of the future actually my answer I have no answer yeah maybe you have an answer for us so what do you think as you you know now yeah we should be focusing on what industries should well any day you have to make a product but more and more of the product requires much more software so even if I do a electric car the battery indu the ACDC converter the induction motor I still need the software to do the chip management so it's not just Hardware alone so we even really want to build you need to build more and more software people because a lot of the systems have become it's just like using uh dips does the uh the training of the chip buying all your data but the key is inference in in in the AI chip is you train with a database Ste people's information but then you have to use it to infer so the inference challenge is there so in the same way Singapore must find way to do the inference job uh and basically know how the key constraint to software is Talent is people intensive so unless we get uh population increased by more than 35,000 babies I have a choice I like to recruit another 10,000 50,000 kidnapping everybody here because the software is is good intensive we can't survive just on own 35,000 babies makes no sense uh if I were in the government I say I going kidnap or K I was with in Hanoi uh was we when Mr was sick and myself and him and and his s so and we he gave us talk to all the Communist leaders of vet government they asked him to give a talk after a talk uh and then we had dinner with the all the Deputy Prime Ministers and one Mr Lee Phio steals our people because I brought in 500 50 kids from Vietnam SE three I PID for all the SE three to jc2 but one condition every student that comes to sing Under My scholarship AA must a and every subject so they thought J I say well I using my money and you are smart kids there no reason why you cannot get a and have a good life and to prove the point the first batch brought 100 I sent 10 of them back they message got true so compare the Ministry of Education I'm a harder guy because my believe if you know to balance your time you can work hard and still have a life no excuse and they all did well so so the vietnames came here uh students from India China all they came here it well I interview one girl uh father is a farmer in scai or Cai every morning she wakes up at 5:00 4:00 take the school bus pick up M around they collect different kids they reach Singapore School 7:00 from b 1 to a Lev every year perfect score why not so I give a scholarship bachor PhD now Singapore I need to K more of those kids I went to Penang uh chief minister L Waring Please Don't Steal My People so he he had a big ceremony said Philip I got one boy and one girl the highest students with a level malan a Lev so there and there I offer a scholarship one of the boys the girl the father want to S the us so I took the boy it came to Singapore do physics and us I subsidized the schy to one of my companies so if I were running government kidnapping is a key function so if I were to follow up on this and ask you a more sensitive question so if I'm a young Singaporean I'll be very worried now because there be so much competition all this kidnapping of people now what do you say to the young Singaporean you see well uh K my good friend my son's complain you bring all the Vietnamese kids and our JC give me a hard time why they hungry why can't Singapore kids compete with them you know they very kids come here they stay in the doet Tre I put n High all so yeah from Monday through Friday in school Saturday Sunday stay in the D studying if Singapore cannot compete it's their fault I mean ultimately because these kids are really hungry my first patch I first took in in SGI International the first patch I have to sell 208 206 so I gave away the first IB certificate to 54 of them who was the top student my Vietnamese scholar all eight subject five prizes he came to Singapore the first year could not speak English in fact I remember I brought Tama to meet us so Tama asked the girl say the first year I was crying every day but they learn the key factor that drive these people is hunger if Singapore kids are not hunger good luck to them I don't mean a very good politician so if you were a young student because there are a couple of them in our mid today yeah what would be your advice for them in terms of what to study you know you talk about AI right AI is going to take our jobs right so what would you advise them to do well lucky or not it's easier to study a heart science or engineering and can always learn soft subjects as engineer I can read philosophy I can read economics I can read history not the other way around so by right you have a certain core of in fact some us universities got this liberal study they're not liberal they got science engineering and they have human build around it we are pure Humanities unless you become a journalist or writer stuff so in a sense you like it or not you have to take some good maths physics uh chemistry and then you can do the soft subject so really we look education is good to have a hard and soft combination uh purely sof I don't see how the guy who has a heart science can always pick up softw subjects so if education system we should have fundamentals of math physics in America for medical students because they have do a bachelor degree to apply to medical school they must have physics you don't have physics you cannot do engineering you don't have mathematics you cannot do so basic is mathematics and physics chemistry you can learn biology can read uh philosophy can read too so lucky or not the education must have core of hard core in the center and a soft so you want the all arounded person a person who got philosophy history but you need the good Sciences so an educ system that is purely liberal all the way I don't know how it going to survive MH and in Harvard bus school I was there we have three C of students in our class I was there in 7476 35% are Engineers a business school another 30% are business studies and undergraduate and other remainder are the philosophers boys so when it come to do number crunching the poor liberal arts English guys are lost it's not their fault because like you're not in the business school you have to crunch numbers you got to do projection and financial analysis so when I get anyn report like this I can read very fast I look at the numbers and then say where the compan is going for them they look at where where's the Poetry where's so we used to dist our Li and we used to sit down and help them because when it come to writing they're very good so I ask can they help write the case studies for us so you need a combination of the three groups of people people who are numerical people are also literal and hopefully a Balan education so a good education system must have hard and soft subjects so if I were you I would take a hard one because easier to learn soft subjects why it's hard to do the so a good maths uh good physics are fundamental and I remember I met some people were you know scientists and what's a PhD astronomy so I said why do you study astronomy because the brain is very difficult there are many neurons it's almost like a Galaxy so lucky or not many of neuroscientists are physicists definitely not uh poets for sure so you've you know in your presentation actually what you charted was really extraordinary story and it seems like it's only the Highlight VI right everything is a success but surely there are ones that Got Away surely there are some mistakes surely some regrets maybe can I ask you to share with the audience what are some of the things that you look back and say oh I shouldn't have done this well the the most difficult uh challenge for me when I was is I just have enough manpower there are more projects I want to do and secondly is my cost land cost labor cost so in EDB I have to be selected what are the industries I can bring here what I have to foro so therefore I came the idea maybe I can move some of these companies I cannot attract to my neighborhood so at least I can service them I can also Supply part so when I start that bottom industrial part the reason very simple I came J 86 by 1987 full employment the government slam me a worker a levy quarter so so I got a company at Thomson electronic we are making components uh devices for the TV but now your labor C okay okay produ the components I ship the bottom to sample that's how I surviv so Thompson Electronics surviv because as simply you know there's no better instrument than the eyes in text so the S test is very L int I went to sum electric they make all the wire HS for the automotive cars they ask me for 500 workers I say in Singapore 500 workers to do Automotive top so I mve the bottom so I took 250 Indonesian kids 12 years 18 18 years old 21 send him to Japan for 6 months second back for two months by the way they went to Japan with a Japanese government's approval on my letter of of such requests indan Minister could not get his authority I wrote to the minister of of Labor in Japan I need this worker to be train so tomorrow will to train them take care them 500 and they produce all the assembly so Singapore can never go to the assembly but the part and comp but time come to Singapore port from Singapore over the world so we still get services so what people don't realize botom depends on Singapore right not the other way around so there are industries that I really cannot do if I go to Pang now I have a factory down my Aerospace but is not having labor problem we produce parts for air bus and boing we have 1,700 workers there and still in manufacturing uh they labor tight so now now also had to bring in foreign workers and P same problem as us so now I create a new Factory in uh aaya and chur last year November I was in churri to create two more companies to take some of the work from Pang today so now I have 400 workers in in Thailand by 2026 when a new Factory is up I should have a th workers in Thailand so are there any industries that you regret any companies Industries they regret bringing or they thought well I shouldn't have brought them in well we try every industry except uh Casino by the way I was nearly involved with that lucky uh because you know even you asked to do Services what services can we do so one of the thing was uh tourism I live to tourism uh Financial Ms Logistics we can do it Casino was also China was be I remember we also went to Disney World try to get Disney to do a Disneyland here they ask 1,000 hectares I don't have 1,000 hectares so so many of this uh projects are quite challenging because land and labor so I would say in Singapore the resource constraint of Labor is a key constraint there's no sub that's why we must always push to higher value higher uh value added uh more automation you look our factories in Singapore J well automated we have only l in fact the last statistic I check was 12% of our labor force are in manufacturing and we produce a respectable 19 to 10% % of GDP most young oppon are not aware of that Hong Kong manufacturing share GDP 1% not many peopleware they have no M because all went to C Hong Kong is none so two months ago some friends from Hong Kong can you see me we're taking a set of Advisory board can you come and help us because they used to love a Singapore you all manfa what you do manufacturing their labor no manufacturing depends which part of the value chck what is Trum now trying to do just to try to kill the 54 uh ship act says look tsmc is going to come here because I use tariff there's no need to give money so America now is desperately trying to get manufacturing back that's get back but the key is that if they all Americans are thank God is Thursday not Friday you cannot have manufacturing if my industry is highly automated highly dependent on big machines the most important person for running machine besides the worker who's programming it and then repair maintenance people if the machine breaks down I'm dead so instead of buy one uh DMG machine which is a million dollars I buy three because the key problem of automation is maintenance Personnel the guy repairs a machine machines all break down no Machine Works forever so you need good Engineers you good maintenance people that's why in Singapore we are smart to have poly Technic people you you know when the machine breaks down they you are stuck especially in the industry that is high value High added Capital intensive you cannot afford to shut down so whenever I look at our factories in plan I always worry you are now technician to repair because the machines will break down and the machines cost a lot of money a million dollars in fact we bought six new machines for a factoring plan the machines didn't work they fly technicians from Germany spend months fixing it and I told my people don't pay the Germans ask them to fix it first finally work but show you you buy more Capital Equipment more maintenance if you buy electric car when a car doesn't work you have to run to Workshop Electronics gu is there so the more automated you are the more D you are the more dependent on repair people it literate and so therefore like it or not the skill set of young in a PO te are very important if you go to the hospital now all the MRI machines all the CT scans all run by young people and they all poly people they are obviously not philosophers they are poliy keeping the machines going so if you look at Medical Services go to the hospital I see a shma equipment you need good technicians good Engineers uh besides doctors in fact the doctor is one of two guys the rest of the hospital is the cost of Hospital bit now is $1 million one hosital B $1 million and when the machine doesn't work and you have a problem maybe we open up the floor to questions yeah yep uh we'll take a two or three questions at a goal and then you know we'll answer okay U maybe there first and then uh this gentleman there yeah no I think we have a question up up there right hi this is aliser here right at the back thank you so much for sharing the question I have is that just now as we hear about kidnapping all those around the region and singaporeans getting too comfortable waiting for vouchers only what do you think is the fate of singaporeans do you think that because we have been too comfortable with the policies government being very efficient that we are not adventurers to venture around outside of Singapore too tight back here to the BTO and we need to just go through the whole system in life what do you think will happen to singapor if we continue to be that way and what do you think we can do okay thank you one more question maybe this gentlemen yeah uh my name is Satya I am from a bank called SMBC uh Mr yo uh before I ask my question your advice on one bag is particularly relevant today postco because so many bags get lost uh my question is uh with regard to Johor Singapore sez you know I was particularly interested in the early part where you talked about how we are not dependent on services in the region but now it's obviously much more important to work in the region to grow economic output uh and Johor and and the Malaysian relationship is obviously uh has been a tenuous one um so from the economic growth point of view uh how do you think uh Singapore can make jss EZ a successful economic multiplier for Singapore okay thank you got it okay maybe one more question and then yeah uh that oh sorry that the gentleman there yeah and then just just hold on for the next round yeah hi um just two very short questions um one about if Singapore is going to move into more high value added sectors because it can't compete on labor costs then what's what is the industries that's going to um uh absorb Surplus employment so how do we deal with the problem of employment if we're going to move into industries that require less and less labor um and then the second question had is as I understand it from the history of Singapore EDB held a very Premier position as like the head of Singapore's developmental State and lots of the top brass came from EDB like yourself but now as the permanent Minister said with other Industries um taking for um and even places like imda and Mas even playing a developmental role what is the role of EDB today does it still hold that Central developmental role does it have to work with other uh development agencies as well thank you okay great maybe let's start with the first question okay kidnapping and are singaporeans too comfortable you know what we should do is that minist education should arrange for our secondary school kids to send to Cambodia Vietnam do a semester there the kids there are hungry know Singapore kids do not realize you go to Vietnam our Factor now now we have 18 Parts under Sam cour our chman there the V kids are very hungry so the diffic of Singapore G they always look at American model European model holiday Disney World you go to Vietnam they have no Disney World they are struggling when I first set industrial park there they all working very hard uh so the key is that maybe one way for Min education is prly send our students not to America send to our asan neighbors to see how people live there work there do their attachment there uh that's why I suggested to uh because I chair the N Business School uh business school I said want to get all your students going into a a Sting with some of our neighboring countries because our neighborhood is still a big gap with us and our young people they are more hungry and there's no other solution unless the parents uh take take away their pocket money on second question uh Joor Singapore s EZ the political difficulties minister of trade industry uh Li Jing Tong came to see me uh two months ago asking me what I can do with uh Singapore jeor zone so I told him if I were a jeor engineer and you pay me 4,000 R I come to Singapore get $4,000 Singapore dollars you think I will stay in jeor because the Gap is serious so I say really if you are to produce in joall I cannot pay them a Singapore salary unless say you joke with me why not pay them two3 so I say my Singapore engineer is 4,000 uh that convert to uh Malaysian currency about 12,000 regate MH so thean my Joo my P Engineers already paid 5,000 R so I told him it's not possible to do manufacturing there because you need unless it's pure labor assembly if you want to higher value and short labor I say the only industry I can see there is Education Health Care uh retirement homes jokingly services are area because that's the area look even healthare is not a minor thing because the healthare really good doctors nurses so for manufacturing is quite a difficult check okay data centers they now have approved 20 data Cent you know what data center power hungry water hungry and very few workers inside you you go to a data centers all computers all the wi is there you think cool the guy sit down there control station control make sure all the batteries are working the construction data center require workers the moment the constru sector is done the sector running very few jobs I sent an article around to some read you know to build a this Center require construction Engineers but once it's done very few people need it so your has approved more than 20 and they now they realize is oh better increase electricity rates on them right it's a fact because why should we subsidize unless you got Hydro power is cheap like in in Bhutan they tried with cryptocurrency they spend a billion dollars on because they got Hydro power generate this is just Bunch tons and tons of computer running it whether it's uh our friend from Nida chips they basic a computer set that almost like PC and they use a lot of energy and you need to cool you need good uh cooling system there but very few jobs so je my view is that really uh should Singapore hland without political application this make sense if I can live in je in fact I was telling the minister dep Minister once you RTS more of the Y people will will take the train to Singapore to work because our housing cost so high why want to live in Singapore if the train is about 30 minutes it makes more sense for JE people to live there and work here in fact also for Singapore to live there and work here unless hdb cool down the C it's a fact of life because I went to uh Forest City for they are having for 3,000 R per square foot a good quality one that's about only 1,000 s our now our Condominiums here are going for 3,000 square foot Singapore dollars so in Pang is different because Pang because we moved to p a long time my P Engineers are only 5,000 R they not complain because housing there is cheaper affordable but even 5,000 rate with labor type eventually have to go to 6 well 6,000 rate divid by 3 is 2,000 sing my Engineers here cost about 5,000 sing M so the Gap is very high I mean I go to jaw I go to Pang uh my Asma drug is $84 here I buy a pank I actually pay only about4 $32 so Singo you go and buy more drugs from they come from the same Factory they come from the same Factory it's true so I was very honest with him he he knows me quite well because I knew him was young he's not depy Minister D Chong I say if you really going to have Manufacturing in je it be a challenge unless you allow me more foreign workers right that means I got to do more of the labor type if you want a Jo engineer the Jo engineer will not stay there will come to Singapore take the RTS it's a fact of that so I'm being frank to him so uh fortunately he's a politician election he's the MP for that area isanda p is the MP there he won the election few times so he's worried about jobs I say most of Mia are working in Singapore here maybe what the fact we should all live in J and Singapore so maybe third question uh we're moving from uh know to a higher value added economy and so he's asking right what's the industry that's going to absorb all this Surplus employment as you know employment becomes manufacturing employment strength manufacturing employment the last statistic is less than 15% yeah 12% 12% so now most of singur are in services and as you know Serv productivity not very high it's quite tough to cannot auto mechanic and the reality is that we have to depend more domestic market so going forward I think we Chinese for government how to make sure that there's enough jobs for Singapore in the services sector Services as Medical Services Health Care Services uh teaching Services the other non for example in a in a restaurant restaurant business quite tough you see a lot of uh food and beverage company labor is tight cost are high they close so economically going forward is quite a challenge because you're now so dependent on domestic market and then the cost are high so we have a big challenge whoever is MP of the area better worry because it's a fact of life J try if we go to J now more and more traffic jam there to many vehicles going down because they can automate they can upgrade they use real people I eventually take our MTH employment of manufactur maybe down 10% mhm 10% when I was first work manufacturing employment of share manufactur 25 maybe 30 now we're down to 12 50% can even go down to 10% but Engineers more technicians less blue color worker you see if you look at my automated machines big machines the worker doesn't do anything just Program stand on there was a machine it's not and the whole place e ition is not dirty is clean so idea of factories are dirty is not true in fact the floor is spotless clean it's better than hospital because I cannot spill oil and 24 by7 fully aor in a sense it played to our strength because you know our population shrinking but also more educated so the challenge is politically how to find enough job this is not only Singapore you look at automotive industry in Japan in Germany the automotive industry is dependent on mechanical engineering distance engine cylinder transmission gearbox those all gone what is the electric car a golf cart the battery four wheels a motor in fact the EV car either AC DC to AC because motos run better AC one motor behind induction motor one in front the next St they have a motor for every wheel so your car can park sideways but so where are the jobs for more and more country will face a problem because if the EV Frankfurt of course uh sugat will be in trouble Nagoya will be trouble because all the mechanical industry are gone there's no reator in the car now so I can imagine any country that's why China is smart they jump straight to EV because All Electronics that's why electronic industry semiconduct very important in China today the EV car in China is not a car it's an entertainment system so the everything is Music Entertainment everything is there so now they have a new they have a new rare article they lot of graveyard because a lot of new EV car start up the company collapse you got the car but your software is outd you got a car electric car is a basically a computer on Wheels it's not your normal automotive engine right the the challenge is that the electric car is still more expensive than IC but byd have brought the price down to almost as good as 10,000 and they are focusing on share volume so if the electric the key cause of electric car is a battery the batter is coming down faster so a lot of changes China uses uh lithium iron phosphate battery the Western Country use maganese Cobalt different batteries and the Chinese batteries are supposed to be safer unless they switch so you look a key in electrical energ is chemistry semiconductors induction motor ACDC converters are standard and the Key software Entertainment System uh software in fact a good electric car there no to go to Workshop you can all the software downloaded it's just the apple as you update your software so electric car really will change the whole employment big change for us Germany and Japan now the key Advantage people are scared of called range worry range okay uh who has said byd say they aiming for 1,000 kilometers one charge that comes about but really most most of us in cities we don't need 1,000 kilometers from Jong to uh Changi is only about 40 kilm so really we are driving at most we about 100 kilm a day so there's no R for range anxiety but it's all meant for worry so now there's a grab more and more hybrid cars yep that's the only thing so worry them maybe the last question of this group uh does EDB still play a Central Development role that's well I hope so because someone has to bring you the bacon to Singapore uh you see EDB is different from tomasic GIC when you are GIC people come and kiss your hands please invest in me or EDB we have to kiss there it's a tough job and we are competing against I just had a zoom last night my Indonesian friends uh the new uh CIO Chief investment officer of Dan Tera so he asked me to zoom in at 10:00 you want to zoom to 12 say sorry I got 1 hour and they are trying to build up the so Ware fund uh P was fell us internet because I night because myself friends from us from Europe all zooming in to help them you know to me indes you worth chasing they quite Keen so I thought you were we have two Sovereign fund got GIC very different one invest in assets yeah one in equities and so on so trying to learn in fact they're supposed to come next week I say well you I'm free I join you otherwise so I get request for free advice I never charge Chong I didn't charge my Indonesian friends cuz I zoom so I don't have to travel I don't complain but when Chon come see me I'll give my advice so I come to a point I get unpaid give free advice hopefully EDB remains important yeah next round of questions gentlemen here is this okay yeah hi uh thanks Mr y thanks Mr CH uh my name is Ki I'm a I was a biophysicist then I changed to law uh so I'm my question is more technical um uh coning two technologies um one is uh quantum physics uh uh Quantum and the other one is uh nuclear okay so my first uh my first question is concerning Quantum Quantum uh as most technical people would know there is a step up concerning as as opposed to classical uh systems Quantum Computing as opposed to classical Computing so my question is given the different nature want to pick your mind on these questions given the different nature of quantum what kind of business models can we uh build around quantum to leverage on the technology that's one question question two is nuclear uh it seems to me that um my take away from this conversation is that uh Singapore needs uh industries that are very dense high density high value density uh Industries um so I think Quantum and tech and and uh nuclear are two of those Industries my question for for nuclear is this where do you think we can put our nuclear plants uh in Singapore uh given your previous experience uh doing petrochemicals in D Island and uh where can we source for all the all the you know inputs thorium all the different problem deals that's the question two third question is yeah sorry last question last question my my last question is what are your thoughts on the asan power grid thanks okay Quantum nuclear asan power GD someone else yep are are you asking question somebody there okay great oh there's a lady there's a lady there u i I've been Wai with hand for a long time so I'm going to try to grab I'll come to you soon after yeah maybe maybe the lady first since she's been waiting there for a while sorry I missed you hi uh I'm Irene ho I'd like to find out what you think about the problems facing Singapore in the future relating to what's been happening with the the uh Nvidia chips okay what kind of problems uh and it just pointed to me that there's something interesting going on and we are likely to get more of this kind of thing as the uh trading environment gets tougher okay great thank you this gentan thank you so I'm going to sneak in this question uh my name is Andre I'm a I'm a subscriber of your notion that manufacturing is important for the country so my question is on manufacturing if in the 1980s we were known to be cheaper and faster as our value proposition to the world in today's new world right what should Singapore's design principle be and value proposition to the world in manufacturing should we still be cheaper and faster is that still relevant or what should we be uh I think that that is a question thank you thank you maybe one last one this gentleman sir thank you for your sharing my name is uh W2 I've been spending the past 12 years between Singapore and West Joor uh may I have your concurrence that in order for Innovation to happen one has to break existing rules uh I've admired you for your past record in the art of breaking rules without getting into trouble so for the sake of the survival of the future of Singapore in my very non-educated opinion we need to break some rules we need to be more empathetic to Southeast Asia we need to be more multilingual and make more effort [Music] to understand stand and to speak Regional languages so with your very big influence in society and in the system uh what are your suggestions for us singaporeans to be able to go forward and be a step ahead of the competition uh because from my grassroot perspective in Peninsula Malaysia and in Singapore uh I find that the Malaysians are much more humanistic empathetic to close the deal and to make things happen unlike the many young singaporeans I see today thank you thank you okay let's go through questions quite quickly because we have 10 minutes left but maybe just uh command first on Quantum nuclear and then the asan power grid well recently uh Microsoft announced that they got a quantum computer running there's article on my table where the scientific Community disagree it they me claiming so nobody know but I think the AI move faster than Quantum Computing is a fact so a lot of the quantum is China is also work in Computing and they're quite expensive they're using CIT so still this is like uh holy challice of computing Quantum yeah so between AI I think AI can do faster because you can uh you don't have to be S Hardware demanding quum is quite Hardware demanding it's quite expensive yeah you have vied on nuclear your views on nuclear power no nuclear power Abu Dhabi they now going for small nuclear power plants small Nu plants in the sense 100 megawatt 200 megawatt so the future to them is dispersed rather than one big nuc Power Plant of 2,000 megaw and also in the say it's also safer so some countries are experimenting that not many of you are aware in 1970s uh T soon Hing F including myself many us were taking out physics because the Singapore government look at nuclear power in 1970s so I I I I was accepted by any to do physics RAM joh wased for physics H was phys Nuclear Physics uh things but there's no clinical power plant so most are unemployed but now in America nuclear fish is coming back in China they are producing 10 nuclear power plants per year France has 54 nuclear power plants Germany is hot L now so French sell to now the demand for nuclear power plant not the giant ones the small one is coming back so you are smart student nuclear engineering is back business again so what's your view on the viability of the Assan power grid well the aan power PL has been discussing for a long time the key is uh compatibility different systems you need to harmonize and standard so I don't know whether they can achieve that uh we are I think with us and J is possible Indonesia some people talk about to batam but you go to Jakarta not too sure because it's a physical uh constraints we are not one landmarks we are separate by water and every so not so so easy but idea going to small nuclear power plants is a possibility in fact we did in the 70s we look at Tong when I was M maybe put a power plant to come everybody's SC people in ch get fright but today is not the nuclear power plant smaller it's possible so you watch what the people are doing now in in the Middle East some countries doing it Abu Dhabi is doing it smaller ones and also the whole process of the uh the nuclear material being used so it will come but the the cost is high uh you can bring it down so it's at District cooling now can District power why not so whether we are will to experiment maybe we could put a small Nu power plant and our military Camp to go supply all the people in ch okay moving swiftly on next question is on Nvidia you know the recent Nvidia case and also the the fact that we are going to see a lot more export controls for chips yeah so how would that affect Singapore well inidia China constitutes 12% of its Market Revenue so inidia is now caught between the China and us and and although they downgrade the chip to H20 whatever but what is happening that the Chinese are doing their own chips Huawei is doing their own chips Alibaba own ships matter of time and they have the chip design they have smic the semiconductor industry of China so the more the American put a squeeze on China you force them to be independent if they are smart will sell them they can always cut P raise a price what the Chinese are not still people they have enough Engineers so where is fic with Huawei or Alibaba they will do it maybe not the fastest ship that's what de had done so in the reality D depends on China market so in a sense uh so I was told that D chin New Year went all the way to China to talk all the customers please buy my chip right don't forget Nidia is not a new company you've been around for a long time they were doing graphic chips for gamings all the chips for gaming people who sit on the spend hours so that become important in the AIA because it's all either training the chip or the chip so the is doing uh AMD track has not done well uh there are not many other countries I think other company in Nidia that's right yeah but what's the implication for Singapore I think the lady was asking well so far we allowed to buy uh hope hopefully we are some some people are called selling to Malaysia but if our companies can use the H20 or better chips I see no reason why we can't build up uh support the more more training and development it can be done so Singapore is still in the green card we are not on the black Le M uh now America tightening up but you know it makes no sense the more they tighten up the more the Chinese will do it yeah I'm quite sure they would do it I remember when Chi was prime minister I to come to Singapore with ch I said there two key Industries for China One semiconductor and two chemicals so I took to J Island I show you the semiconduct plant now in China has all the petrochemical themselves our petrochemical question semic they do it in fact when I was talking he was PM first was DPM PM I said why do you have 20 province buying the own semiconductor plant all day 20 Micron machines because in China there's no National policy every prob want to be king every prob wants to be a semiconductor King you know China is more competitive than America so 100 EV cars 100 EV cars most of are ding they eventually left how many EV cars are there America Tesla GM Tri uh for tribe and then uh R van D China is very competitive the problem is is a very wasted waste food system because everyone compete many SCS left behind but they will survive so in this in the in the Nida chip n's greatest threat is China not any other company in America not AMD even M next question manufacturing what's our value proposition is it still cheaper better and faster uh well we're no longer cheaper for sure uh the key in high you need talent so we can train now bright smart Singapore are not cheap and they can be productive they are not thank God it's Thursday okay survive that's my view and that's the government think that we should give everybody thank God is Thursday you know thank God is Thursday not a joke know because uh there was reading a report about tsmc TSM started the Factory phix Arizona they say all Taiwanese the American Engineers many they quit this is slave labor they want to have a thank God is thirsday the chines Taiwanese go down now now they got Tai restaurant Chinese school for the kids you know same industry is cap in sensive you need people to can run on shift manage the place on shift not Holiday Camp you know not Disney World but the value system must be there you look at our semiconduct you should visit the guys are working because it has to be run on three shift to four shift there's no such thing as uh we work Friday and then switch off so for Singapore is our course is a challenge uh our biggest challenge is not enough manpower we don't have enough Engineers quality Engineers we are worry so maybe you should go and kidnap some more uh all the principles of Singapore uh secondary school should go around hunting give scholarship to aan neighbor kids what's wrong we can afford four years of secondary education even six years education after that if I still 100 20 St are good enough we don't have enough kids in our schools now know some of schools are closing sh because no more babies so last question of this set right from that gentleman there he talked about breaking rules and whether you know the art of breaking rules right and what are some of the suggestions you have for Singapore to go forward well if we break rules must expect with SE so you are not afraid of being sex then you carry on you are scared of your job no man I work with Dr go how as far concern I can always walk out anytime the fact I don't believe I'm a civil servant I mean I'm not obled to stay walk out so I can do all the things and break provid I Break The Rules not my personal benefit I break the rules for the national gain for the mean they have gain the company I don't see any crime right because end of the day I trying to shortcut I give example when I came back in 76 i S4 Dr go asked me CIS sea Oda was 455 so I took over sa I automative engineering all the tanks were in the workshop there's no space how to work so I look across I saw two BR football field compliments of the British army so I last told the football field not much you he smile at me I didn't say anything at 5:00 call my officer put considered a wi one football field G right W you complain to him he laughes he go talk to I told we said look you don't need two full field to play most of the time football is growing grass so that's how sa became and I do have to pay for rent for the space p still okay uh we only have time for one last question here and I want to give one question to the uh people who are who are zooming in so maybe one question of this gentlemen uh thank you m um lexon from mind um so actually you talked about China you talked about us so I guess in your experience across all those many decades of traveling to these countries what in your view are the enduring comparative advantage of the countries you have been through the US China perhaps even regionally as well what is the comp comparative advantage of the enduring comparative advantage yes advantage of of engineering oh no uh of the various countries the US China whether or not based on your experiences traveling to these countries you feel that at a core this is just something that you know well we look at us and China uh China has a population that is four times five times depend educated population you go to American PHD programs most are not American Kids yeah you go to PhD program you look at MIT CCH most of them are Asians I remember when I was uh in the promoting semiconductors over IC industry Indians and Chinese so if you look at higher education the American kids are not very large number in PhD program it's a fact of life in China they have all the kids are 100% Chinese where they all the same quality but don't know they got lot of universities not all top grade sh numbers you see so it's it's a value system most Chinese student go to America to study engineering n then go to study philosophy and it's a it's a value system they say they are not interested in in politics but really that's the way is if you go to Taiwan many of kids are engineering is a fact of life so you look at America America and China is competing on talent and talent the disadvantage of China is homogeneous only Chinese America technically are smart they can steal for everybody I remember I visited uh uh I went to Toronto to visit Aerospace group there was uh 19 2019 I look at Aerospace know Canada is inter I meet all the engineers there I look at him you are from Iran I say I should know I've been in Iran Iran Engineers so if a country can steal people like America or can Canada they can always supplement replace that thank God people so Advantage America immigration of good value people is available yeah on the other hand China has own population so the strength ultimately is talent and there's no other no equipment you can buy for the same companies what comes is year last question from someone online maybe just to end us off can the Singapore economic story last for another 60 years that my answer is not my problem all right on that note let's give a round of applause thank you Mr Y and Mr Chin we come to the end of today's lecture we would like to hear your views on the event please click our link on the Facebook feed or scan the QR code on the screen to submit your feedback Mr Philip your's second lecture titled transforming Singapore's economy economy through research and development will take place on 27 March details will be on our website and IPS Facebook page we hope to see you then thank you [Applause] [Music]\n"

      "so it is my pleasure to welcome you to the IPS NAD lecture series by Mr Philip yo our 16 Sr NAD fellow for the study of Singapore today Mr y will be delivering his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation following his lecture Mr yo will take questions from the audience in the Q&A session the Q&A session will be checked by Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information development at the ministry of digital development and information before we begin please allow me to go over some housekeeping rules for the event thank you for joining us today at the auditorium please be reminded to switch your mobile phones to silent mode the lectur is being streamed live on Facebook it will also be recorded and uploaded onto our IPS website and our social media platforms later please subm me your comments and questions at anytime during the lecture through the Facebook comments for audience members here at auditorium today please step up to the mic during the Q&A session to ask your questions we also like to hear your views on the event there will be a link in the feed at the end of the lecture and a QR code which you can scan to submit your feedback director of ips janit deavon will now deliver his opening remarks director [Applause] please welcome everyone Philip yo our Sr norn fellow for this year is s generis that's Latin for Philip you're one kind one and I can do that's very difficult to introduce him so I will tell two stories which I heard from him first many years ago he may not remember the stor the stories are not exactly about him but about his mentor and Guru uh Dr goking s but it tells you a lot about him the first is a story uh both stories involved I think when you were in minda with him in the early years director what was it planning uh I can't remember what it was but anyway um one day at that time um we had pig farms in Singapore and the pig farms were causing u a lot of problems singaporeans were also complainers then and people complained about the smell of pigs but they also wanted to eat pork um and so how to solve this problem so Dr go calls Philip yo at then what 25 years old something like that uh very young man and calls him in and says look I've had an idea why do we get one of these disused super tankers you know buy them cheap put all the pics on the super tankers and sail the boat the ship out to South China Sea so he asked Philip yo to go and research this idea so Philip yo did and a few days later came back and says uh Dr go pigs don't sweat which is why they roll around in the mug you put them on a super tanker in the middle of the ocean they will all die of heat stroke you will have chasu but not pigs so that was the end of that idea another idea Dr go he reads in some magazine about Krill and how Krill contains very high protein and this story calls up again Philip and says there's this story Krill is very cheap actually the fishermen when they catch the Krill when uh they they throw the Krill away so why don't you go and collect all the Krill free of charge we don't have to pay and then we use it to feed the Army which this time around Philip didn't do sufficient research he did as he was told caught the grill and then we ended up and I remember this because I was in the Army at that time this was early' 70s Dr had just come back to defense from Ministry of Finance we had Crill for breakfast Crill for lunch Crill for dinner at the end of one month Phillip went to doct go and says enough you're going to have a revolt on your hands so that was the end of krill I tell these stories because they illustrate like no other story I've heard how our founding fathers were cranks and there is a definition of genius I can't remember who it was who defined genius as that zigzag flash of lightning in the brain and there is nobody who illustrated that more in the political leadership than Dr go um and nobody in the Civil Service who illustrated that more than Philip yo zigzag flash of lightning in the brain not all cranky ideas are accurate or good so you actually need the philipo in the first guys to go and tell the politician sir you're going to get Chu not pigs second idea you also need somebody like Philip yo to try out cranky ideas so this weird combination of the ability to speak truth to power and also willingness to try out crazy things is what produce the Singapore of today right you if you can't if you if you only have people who take the safe way the predictable way we wouldn't have got the Singapore of today now I have not read the remarks that were prepared for me because it's very difficult to capture philipo unless you've known him or worked with him neither of which I've done but certainly I'm old enough to remember the Philip yo who played such a huge seminal role um in the development of Singapore I won't summarize what he has to say um uh except uh to say that um you will hear plenty of evidence of the zigzag flash of lightning that's genius so without Much Ado please Philip thank you so much director ladies and gentlemen without further Ado I would like to invite Mr Philip yo to begin his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation Mr yo [Applause] please okay let me put out the first slide this slide is important for Singapore and is also for me from 1960 to 65 I was happy in HGI in the library in 6 1966 I went off to Toronto I came back in 70 as an Industrial Engineer so my whole career started from 1970 when I spent my first job other shot one man with finan was Ministry of Defense so I've been working with Ministry defense from 1970 which the same time as skill intensive 1970 to 1994 most people don't know that I was my payroll even was EDB was still in defense from 19 but i mov from EDB 86 1984 and I was always say what's important is that during my 1970 to 94 although was also evv all my work was industry defense industry I produced motor bombs M16 anti aircraft ammunition build warships rebuilt the Skyhawks so all my career has always been industry so very naturally when Singapore got in trouble at an EDB and EDB are continue the same uh economic role you can see the curve they we have to move to more and more uh particular Industries so in a sense if I look at my this calendar here this chart here is from 1970 to 2006 it's always economic so let me go to the next one the faces I think most sing is aware actually we took off only in 1970 the British left Singapore in 19697 and my first job in defense was to create jobs for Singapore is retrenched by the British Army and that's how I end up building up a defense industry to create jobs for sing for so next phase was Capital intensive for which is important that we have to go into more and more uh labor constraint for unemployment to almost full employment by the 1980s and technology which are continue so my whole career is from the 70s to the 1990s to 2000 now where we are today everybody knows that so I won't emphasize on that now this is important chart when I took over EDB 86 I was a b member of Ed 82 to 85 I was a pump sa in defense I was also chairman computer board defense industry so I was there so I realized in EDB in 1986 how can we contribute the GDP of Singapore at that time uh we had about trying to aim for 25% share of GDP which a tough number and at least 20% of employment of Singapore must be industry but today you look at it employment of singap in Industry today is about 12% 15% but our allp put is HS higher our manufacturing sector is hard to keep at 25 because labor constraints to really look at Singapore 15% of our employees of singapor are working for Industries to produce 20% of GDP it's very significant very few singapor are add that most of our industries that are manufacturing are export there is no local market it 85% of economy is Services which is domestic maybe for Logistics or Ship Repair shipping most of industries that we have sample is that we have less than 15% of population in manufacturing we producing 19% to close to 20 depend on the year of the GDP what's interesting to look at the numbers I ask for breakdown Electronics multinational chemicals multinational bom medical multinational you look at the share of the value added very high I look at Precision Engineering transport G these are more local companies the value is low so from this two data you can see that the multinational companies contrib a very large percent of economic sector and also they give jobs to the local Precision Engineering and uh and bi medical General manufacturing so we need to that combination why do we push for manufacturing I remember I had a long dinner Mr with manufacturing I don't depend on my neighbors if I try to sell services to my neighbors they will never buy so what they have done is manufacturing ski for us to get out of Singapore and drct go play a very important part when I came back from Toronto in 1970 my first job was trying to escape the PSC chairman PSC here because they need offer me a job for one month I applied for a job with a company called L Industries L industry like Texas was one of the semiconductor companies that Singapore so my first job offer offer me as a engineer Industrial Engineer with industry the PSC say sorry you can't you go you're bonded so I stay on then I complain uh how about EDB uh you also cannot go because EDB is actually bought for two month so two job offers the industries rejected rejected how about going to the Ministry of Finance I end up in finance for one month after one my complain is not engineering job uh doing budget work oh they're looking for assist engineer and me they have so that's it so I been there all my own free will now what you can see in Singapore that we really mov when I first joined 1970 came back Singapore was making a magnetic CES any of here magnetic memory CS put a wire through that's how we did very low value but create a lot of jobs and Singapore create a lot of jobs so then we going to next so today we are down more balance unlike many countries around Singapore we are not dependent on one sector we we actually grown I explain the share Precision Engineering which makes a lot of key parts for the D drive electronics and semiconductor we still have a semiconductor industry which is important by the way I set up Charter industry chter Semiconductor in 87 and the same year as tsmc unfortunately tsmc at the full support of the government Singapore government says Liv to multinational that's what happened uh energy chemicals are there and you have the Aerospace Aerospace so if we look at Singapore we are more Diversified than Taiwan Taiwan is only one industry semiconductor we are more balanced fi and partly because unlike Taiwan most of the companies we have are multinational in Taiwan most the company are local if I remember years ago when I to Taiwan Taiwan has a tari of 30% Singapore no tari tyan has a sizer population we don't have so in a sense un like Taiwan uh we have to depend on multinational Investments That give us what Dr go call they bring us technology uh they bring us production know how and the most important is management and markets and Dr go is a very key person in in the defense in the economic of EDB uh when I was in uh in defense he was still involved in the defense industry was also created by Him to create jobs for singaporeans most of you are not aware I involved in amation tanks should produce the first cette for the Navy unit 87 uh rebuild a skyw so all this was because to create jobs we have gone through that phase now everybody knows this now our industry because of our population size we have to constantly upgrade there's no way for us to uh take on labor intensive jobs so you look at transformation that way now we have the done everything by multinational and uh in semiconductors we done it but the key industry we had in the early 70s was a semiconductor long before anybody appreciate long before besides own Ship Repair and as far concerned the semiconductor industry has given us very Brad P the same skills are here today we don't produce uh one particular company but we have many more companies here uh this is it we are in chip design We Are W for fabrication we produce all the this year we do assemble test now assemble test is the most labor intensive so we move when I was EDB help encourage them to move to Pang so you see a lot of the assem test in P actually from Singapore same the people there because we use pan as our more of the labor and we focus on upgrade so Singapore and pan has a very unique relationship unfortunately sing J doesn't have the same let me go on to here okay 1985 uh I was still defend froms so uh I was asked by Minister of Finance that time TR industry ton can you be a chairman of skill Development Fund so Al the problem so September 19985 when I still in defense I took a job job of chairman SK fund then I realized economy was really sinking so can you please come over it be halftime in defense halftime from January 86 I say well I try M I give up I just move over remain as a pump defense and ODP full-time in Jan 86 you look at the data here this are first recession remember manufa is a very key component in 1986 the employment is more than 20% of Singapore population at one time was more than 25 but to is gone down it was a big shock to us that's what I did now EDB has never advertised in the whole history from 1961 to 1986 so when I Tred to Market this advertisement with the Wall Street Financial Times the ministry of trade industry says sorry got no budget so I complained my Minister says no budet why not use some of your reserves so I had to dig with own pocket and run this advertisement and this advertisement I went around to see my good friends in America these are all wellknown companies some are still around and they sign off uh and this was the first time we realized we have how to promote Singapore because at that time one the kid problem on 85 recession was our share our cpf was 25% your contribution 25% by the company at 50% cpf you killed all the companies so 85 recession I always believe is self created self-inflicted anyway after a retire from EDB in 2010 some my fellow uh colleagues sign this off for me as my reputation are working anyway it's a joke now our recovery was good we push for more and more high value production especially trying to move away from uh low value added industry of Refinery the services sector we took on three new sector it sector business headquarters uh Medical Services I try to promote to and uh these were the services we try because in manufacturing I can automate I can produce higher productive in Services harder so my rule of time easier to upgrade manufacturing and to provide services unless the services of high value and next was how to diversify the regional market and those are thing let me take the chemical sector Singapore has been a refining Center over 100 years but the value added is very low we produce refined products for gasoline for kerosene that's it and we are selling these products to the region the low value add is very low so the key constraints was how do we uh at create more jobs the only way to create more jobs in the chemical sector is to go down down the Christmas tree go down to more and more products so came idea I I need to go down the petrochemical route I need land and land is not so easy available in Singapore in fact I went to look at Sosa Island and then the tourist was horrified they're going to steal the island by anyway Sosa island is too small but only 400 450 hectares not very big what I wanted was 3,000 hectares very ambitious because my idea if I I have 3,000 Hees I can have at least three petrochemical comp complex I can produce 3 million tons eth every petrochemical complex is one ethine million tons so minimum three but still four or five to create mass at the same time I want the chemic industry to be link to each other so one a produce something goes to B produce go to C so it's integr itself is is almost a full cluster rather than stand load and this idea was to create and most and secondly one on the island where nobody lives I went to Rotterdam I went to Houston I saw all the houses around them every now there's a fire so I said know the only way is to put in my Island so I asked the government for a budget of 7 billion they nearly fainted so usually I thought okay we start with 500 900 eventually today we have 3,200 hectares that's almost 8,000 acres of land is still available but the chemical entry is changing so now we have to look for what else can we do so I'm spending time with some my EDB colleagues what industries can we put in J Island besides the petrochemical complex now this is good example of anyway Skip One now this is how we refine uh you see refining is low value added now we are down to Specialty Chemicals Petr chemical is there so EDB collect are chasing special chemicals more high value lower volume with good prices and they dependent but at the same time what else what else can we do so the big challenge for Singapore is how to keep on moving ahead because the key challenge for us how to remain linked to the world to manufacturing not just service in the region so now we come to what we have now what most of you are not aware when I try to go down to Farmer production we have no land so I asked my EDB colleagues can we reclaim some more land so from near the shipyards in j where called the to area I asked them to help to reclaim and they reclaim about 300 280 hectares so all the farmer Industries all there and they allocated they share the same utility they same all the needs in the sense they already compact if you go to any farmer company in America us is one company here one company there all SC country here is all P to do today we produce eight of the top uh biological drugs in the world we don't own them uh we produce the drugs for all the companies we have no generics generics are India China Thailand we are all propi because the margins are high but it's a industry that we have packed together and we have trained people for the industry every time there's a new drop we hope they bring it to Singapore so today we have a good these are all the companies here all brand names unfortunately we don't have a local names uh these are all International names and these are names you do not see in Taiwan for sure right now in Hong Kong now and we continue to grow we have to continue grow because uh the biomedical industry biological Industries are very most of drugs are for cancer and other uh difficult diseases but on the other hand the value is very high every time there's a new drug we try to bring them to Singapore EDB colleagues and their job bring here why every drug has a patent life of 17 years the first seven years plus is clinical trial and there's no Revenue when the drug is approved by FDA the St is 10 years only so when I bring them to Singapore we give them the support in the tax holiday they got 10 years of pure cream beyond that somebody will do a generics harder to do with cancer drugs but that's it now all those things we have done most of the sing now I'm no longer EDB I spend my time needling them says are you worried so I thought my good I can ask uh Kong to come and worry us yeah Kong do serve as MDB and as you know EDB is is a place where we travel with one suit case you got five shirts and four trousers Monday to Friday no checking luggage you want check luggage you can join another Ministry yeah so our let me just put this way our operating environment has really changed we all read in the news we have a geopolitical we have trade tariffs the tariffs are going serious we might be CAU it tax incentives our tax incentives no longer be useful and just Big Challenge we have to modify but we are lucky we are in a region aan region I always tell my col it's important region that most of us better learn the speak besides manding Bahasa very young people don't understand that because our neighborhood is still uh lots of Malaysia Indonesia combined together can give us about only 300 million competition for talent the biggest challenge for Singapore last year we had only 35,000 babies I said so we need to go and kidnap and when I was Ed I specialize in kidnapping I take young kids from the region Vietnam India China bring them in young bring them young at 15 you can indoctrinate them they grow up to be singaporeans they bring over 21 they will not be singaporeans so if you really want to grow Singapore KET the best and brightest from the region free education Singapore from seary to jc2 then you got a new Singapore ready made right and ai ai is an area where I was just reading an article I sent to a k you know dips it sounds very simple what's happening now is not dpck they apply dips in every industry the key is not AI the key is how to use it depends on the industry whether I can use it in drug development I can use it in manufacturing I can use in banking so the key is that AI will possibly change the biggest difficulty was that AI I also change employment so employment is another area where I really can for example there a doct I say know when you go for X grade you got depend on the X-ray uh technici take a look but lot of the AI can do of the mundan work which means the demand for skill set will change the only industry that safe are medical services are still safe you a doctors you need nurses every other industry whether they accounting auditing all other Str now nobody knows how bad but it will be happening and these are the key risk so for every if I were the Singapore business Federation will be worrying these are the issue that we have to worry uh how are we going to because nobody knows Mr Trump has been Office foress 100 days already and we all in a spin uh last day I was watching the speech uh we call call reciprocal tariff if we put a t 10 % you put 10% so you going to change a LW you know America for example Mexico and Canada all exports to United States is tar free now he want slam 25% he just get a retrie for one month for the automative industry because automated is well integrated between Canada us and Mexico there a lot disruption uncertainty uh I think politically will be a challenge for young uh government because who knows uh where where we are going but key for us is Singapore Singapore has to be prepared we have to look at advantages of each of these sectors what else can we do so in a sense uh looking forward our EDB officers we have to start thinking how how do we navigate the changes now this is I emphasize to my colleagues uh I work a lot with Indonesia uh started B industrial state 1990 by 1992 was Full Employment I moved to Vietnam today Vietnam uh vsip was my project 94 now there are 18 parks in Vietnam by the same participation I started bang Park 1995 96 16 or know today we are in Bangalore chenai Hyderabad Pune and Bombay so I look at Vietnam we have our uh Mark there in India we have a mark indes a mark China is we have W and so we have to look at maybe we can take advantage position Singapore to take advantage of our neighborhood which means we must accept Singapore to get out of comfort of Singapore and go and manage companies there not just sit at home uh waiting for government vouchers now I mention about Talent this is important thing so I was studing uh in ch can you please go and kidnap because America is cutting the ni budget uh my son is a victim there normally for every dollar research you get another 30 cents for supporting a lab uh electricity water so ni cut down to 15% which means you I a professor I Let Go students and Lego it's quite difficulty for them wor they announc that they'll freeze all probation officers anyone in the US government who a probation means a fresh officer your job is gone it should be way you should Tak in the young ones maybe ret return some of the mid Med managers but that's the way it does so many our young PhD students today are job so if I were the Singapore government I go there and kidnap all of them yeah and they it deep s is not just an eight I it's the same way as we apply it throughout I remember when I set Singapore commun system in 1980s applying SCS computer science to all the manufacturing and those days I was using computers many computers in the same way deeps and the similar whether from Alibaba will have great impact on manufacturing and services so I hope our people are churning out I've just read article that China has more than three 300 colleges set up to train people in AI not all succeed but they produce and a day there will be a critical mask that will come up so maybe ask K to come and entertain us now [Applause] thank you so much uh Mr yo for your lecture for those watching the lecture on Facebook please submit your comments and questions through the Facebook comment box for audience members here please step up to the mic to ask your questions may I now invite Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information and development at the ministry of digital development and information to start the qna session thanks very much thanks Mr y uh I don't think we need the mics Okay so so uh as you can tell Mr y's style is very Breezy and quick and you know because I think he wants to get down to discussing and to having a great debate with you guys so before we start can I just ask set some house rules first I'll keep the questions short I know many people will be will want to make comments uh just make a short comment more importantly questions so that Mr yo can answer uh secondly we try to keep to the content of the speech really on economic strategy there's a lot more that you can ask him later but let's focus on economic strategy transformation and maybe his time at uh EDB uh I'm as as you would know know I had the honor of actually in a sense following in Mr y's footstep in EDB and one of the things I always remember is when I came in there was only one rule that uh was there throughout which is that trolley back rule uh everywhere you go you carry One Trolley back no matter where you go no matter whether it was a twoe trip no whether no matter whether you gone to Davos and you had a brave minus 20° C it was a One Trolley back Rule and we even maintained it to this day I don't know about DB now I imagine it's the case uh not because we no we are holding on to it because I think it's a symbol of what EDB stands for and what Singapore's economic transformation is about right we stay lean we stay mean we always hustling we always hungry and we always chasing and we got to move fast uh maybe you want to explain why is why did you Institute the one back trolley rule well I I will I arrive in New York on a Sunday arrest Monday morning I wake up early breakfast I leave a hotel one back because we are going to several cities if you want to check your luggage goodbye to your luggage because you change planes and then there delay so hang out to your luggage for dear life one lug so the ru is five shirts four pants B that's for guys now how about for women ladies Now ladies have to roll up their dresses and sausages because otherwise you know the ladies not smart they roll dresses and simple and always dress we only one coat there a coat you wear so for lady officers who Trav we have to learn the same way one now it sounds a bit cruel because I can wake up in New York and I go to uh B another Chicago I go to kooko to look at Del's equipment under the car then I fly to San Francisco so I get 26 27 hours Advantage mhm my working hour is 27 hours because I moved from New York by time I reach California 11:00 I actually have 27 so that's a way and the other key reason is that we have no time for laundry you do laundry you lose your laundry so you make sure you got five shirts four pants five underwear for sure and five socks yeah and the lady officer adjust to be fair oh my lady when I first join EDB 86 there only five lady officers surely CH a few of people but 50% of ladies so I think I'm better diversity than Mr Trump yeah we always say that the ladies in EDB are always uh one of a kind because they are the ones to volunteer for all the difficult assignments like like going to Mumbai going to you know China okay great so maybe let's launch off from where you ended because you know we are now in a new phase uh when you join EDB in manufacturing uh you know this you could argue that actually the you know the conditions were very rip for the manufacturing takeoff right uh globalization mnc's were expanding yeah in fact just a factoid for you right when the semic you know semiconductors are being talked about quite a bit right now actually the semiconductor industry was one of the first Industries to Offshore off offshore within less than 10 years 7 eight years from Silicon Valley they offsh short first place they offshot because it was too and you know Mr yo talked about the assembly and testing part of it which was really the low value connecting wires the first place they offshot was actually Hong Kong because back then American workers were paid $2.50 an hour Hong Kong 25 cent therea came Taiwan 19 cents yes and guess where Singapore was yeah third in theow third in line 11 cents and that's really how we started and today is a completely different story right if you think about it sure we are probably the most most expensive you compare Hong Kong doesn't really have a manufacturing industry but no Taiwan shenen of course right we are also land is very expensive but more critically now we have carbon as a constraint not plus you have tariffs you have a retreat from globalization you have even the prospect of us and China uh contest so do you still believe that manufacturing is the way to go and if so what are the areas that Singapore can comp sure well in semiconductor up to Mr Biden's time and Trump's recently Us lost all conductor other than Intel AMD for example I used to know them so their Foundry in Dr Germany to Global foundaries IBM in fish uh fish kill upate New York I used to visit them saw The waer Foundry also to Global foundaries who is global Foundry uh Abu Dhabi so Abu Dhabi MD uh mad asked me Mr you we want to put all these companies together in Singapore we also bu semiconductor your company to create Global foundies I said well if you buy Dron Singapore and fish New York and Singapore what's your plan we want to build a waer fat Foundry in Abu Dhabi obviously I kept quite a laugh see he never succeeded but I warn them that Global Foundry in this business you must continually invest you cannot stop so I joking teased the CEO mad I say semiconductor Foundry is having a fence mistress very expensive to maintain that's what happened you look at uh TSM every year he has to invest fur F from five Micron to four Micron treat so it's a very challenging so either you have the money or you have the skill if you don't have the skill for example uh tsmc set a factory in Now Phoenix Arizona they have to export 500 Taiwanese there engine and don't forget and semiconductor industry is a 24 by7 there's no such thing as a thank God is Thursday which is American culture yeah after the earthquake straight away the Taiwanese engineer went went to fix we visit a semiconductor plant in Taiwan s gone they even have doet trees nearby because you are working on Shi three Shi or four Shi you want to have t is Friday you cannot build manufacturing semiconductor and that's why I'm very optim pessimistic that America was suceed Intel is now for sale uh Brock C is looking at Intel and then Trump squee uh T can you please buy The Foundry of Intel so the company the biggest reason why Intel is in this back position because when Apple came out iPhone in 207 he used Motorola chips intel was not interested then Apple switch to a chip arm chips are one designed by British group there's no uh it phone that use Apple phone that uses Intel chips they stuck at PCS and desktop computer so Intel lost it the key fit of future key fit for Intel failing was 207 they didn't want to produce the chip for the phone was the biggest mistake I thought is small value today in everything that we have in the car electric car your home vir is semiconductor semiconductor is more available to us today than anything else you look at electric car the key is a battery is chemistry the battery is a DC so when you charge the car you must charge DC when the car will have to convert from DC to AC to control the the induction motor that control the wheel the semiconductor chip the energy management is semiconductor that's it so lucky or not semiconductor today so perect so Americans now realize the so every country now in the world are trying to have the old own National semiconductor Japan is trying to do the same so in Singapore as far we concerned if we can find our Niche we can stay that it but we need good Engineers a good engineer we train we need to have I remember when 19 when I got Su to be at my empty I bought him back from New York and I say I want to build 25 wer F he nearly fainted why 25 W for f needs a lot of water electricity is one water water has no substitute electricity I can use diesel can petrol and what have you or wind so 25 wer fat require lots of water so s say yeah we cannot talk to Pub they will never agree so we came up Idea new water new water is actually edb's idea if I cannot get water I have to recycle although s promote you can drink it but don't drink it well the Recycled water is pure no impurities you one more water so that is important for deionized water and semiconductor so energy intensive water intensive so that's why in Singapore now we have a sizable semiconductor we are now B uh number three and we produce a lot of common parts that goes to everywhere most of our chips now go to Automotive EV so most singapor don't know that all the chips that we produce are really we don't do SML test all ship it out we do the components it goes up we have the we do the casting we do the shape the design and then it goes up but the thing that most Singapore don't see a because it's all in jurong they only know AER Road they know uh so Singapore do not know that out in j under DTC that's where the export of Singapore is that's where the job is and don't forget the multinationals make a lot of money they keep the money in Singapore Banks that's something but not that's why the doctor created the US dollar because all the mountain at one time G motor was here I remember they oh Mr we have about 500 million dollar Us in Singapore why Singapore is safe place they make their money get tax H they keep their money here everybody is happy yeah but you know so that's really I mean kudos to you and the team right you've really created some engines of growth right you have Electronics you have chemicals and bio Biomat but if you you know if I when I was at EDB if I get a penny for every time someone ask me so what's the industry of the future actually my answer I have no answer yeah maybe you have an answer for us so what do you think as you you know now yeah we should be focusing on what industries should well any day you have to make a product but more and more of the product requires much more software so even if I do a electric car the battery indu the ACDC converter the induction motor I still need the software to do the chip management so it's not just Hardware alone so we even really want to build you need to build more and more software people because a lot of the systems have become it's just like using uh dips does the uh the training of the chip buying all your data but the key is inference in in in the AI chip is you train with a database Ste people's information but then you have to use it to infer so the inference challenge is there so in the same way Singapore must find way to do the inference job uh and basically know how the key constraint to software is Talent is people intensive so unless we get uh population increased by more than 35,000 babies I have a choice I like to recruit another 10,000 50,000 kidnapping everybody here because the software is is good intensive we can't survive just on own 35,000 babies makes no sense uh if I were in the government I say I going kidnap or K I was with in Hanoi uh was we when Mr was sick and myself and him and and his s so and we he gave us talk to all the Communist leaders of vet government they asked him to give a talk after a talk uh and then we had dinner with the all the Deputy Prime Ministers and one Mr Lee Phio steals our people because I brought in 500 50 kids from Vietnam SE three I PID for all the SE three to jc2 but one condition every student that comes to sing Under My scholarship AA must a and every subject so they thought J I say well I using my money and you are smart kids there no reason why you cannot get a and have a good life and to prove the point the first batch brought 100 I sent 10 of them back they message got true so compare the Ministry of Education I'm a harder guy because my believe if you know to balance your time you can work hard and still have a life no excuse and they all did well so so the vietnames came here uh students from India China all they came here it well I interview one girl uh father is a farmer in scai or Cai every morning she wakes up at 5:00 4:00 take the school bus pick up M around they collect different kids they reach Singapore School 7:00 from b 1 to a Lev every year perfect score why not so I give a scholarship bachor PhD now Singapore I need to K more of those kids I went to Penang uh chief minister L Waring Please Don't Steal My People so he he had a big ceremony said Philip I got one boy and one girl the highest students with a level malan a Lev so there and there I offer a scholarship one of the boys the girl the father want to S the us so I took the boy it came to Singapore do physics and us I subsidized the schy to one of my companies so if I were running government kidnapping is a key function so if I were to follow up on this and ask you a more sensitive question so if I'm a young Singaporean I'll be very worried now because there be so much competition all this kidnapping of people now what do you say to the young Singaporean you see well uh K my good friend my son's complain you bring all the Vietnamese kids and our JC give me a hard time why they hungry why can't Singapore kids compete with them you know they very kids come here they stay in the doet Tre I put n High all so yeah from Monday through Friday in school Saturday Sunday stay in the D studying if Singapore cannot compete it's their fault I mean ultimately because these kids are really hungry my first patch I first took in in SGI International the first patch I have to sell 208 206 so I gave away the first IB certificate to 54 of them who was the top student my Vietnamese scholar all eight subject five prizes he came to Singapore the first year could not speak English in fact I remember I brought Tama to meet us so Tama asked the girl say the first year I was crying every day but they learn the key factor that drive these people is hunger if Singapore kids are not hunger good luck to them I don't mean a very good politician so if you were a young student because there are a couple of them in our mid today yeah what would be your advice for them in terms of what to study you know you talk about AI right AI is going to take our jobs right so what would you advise them to do well lucky or not it's easier to study a heart science or engineering and can always learn soft subjects as engineer I can read philosophy I can read economics I can read history not the other way around so by right you have a certain core of in fact some us universities got this liberal study they're not liberal they got science engineering and they have human build around it we are pure Humanities unless you become a journalist or writer stuff so in a sense you like it or not you have to take some good maths physics uh chemistry and then you can do the soft subject so really we look education is good to have a hard and soft combination uh purely sof I don't see how the guy who has a heart science can always pick up softw subjects so if education system we should have fundamentals of math physics in America for medical students because they have do a bachelor degree to apply to medical school they must have physics you don't have physics you cannot do engineering you don't have mathematics you cannot do so basic is mathematics and physics chemistry you can learn biology can read uh philosophy can read too so lucky or not the education must have core of hard core in the center and a soft so you want the all arounded person a person who got philosophy history but you need the good Sciences so an educ system that is purely liberal all the way I don't know how it going to survive MH and in Harvard bus school I was there we have three C of students in our class I was there in 7476 35% are Engineers a business school another 30% are business studies and undergraduate and other remainder are the philosophers boys so when it come to do number crunching the poor liberal arts English guys are lost it's not their fault because like you're not in the business school you have to crunch numbers you got to do projection and financial analysis so when I get anyn report like this I can read very fast I look at the numbers and then say where the compan is going for them they look at where where's the Poetry where's so we used to dist our Li and we used to sit down and help them because when it come to writing they're very good so I ask can they help write the case studies for us so you need a combination of the three groups of people people who are numerical people are also literal and hopefully a Balan education so a good education system must have hard and soft subjects so if I were you I would take a hard one because easier to learn soft subjects why it's hard to do the so a good maths uh good physics are fundamental and I remember I met some people were you know scientists and what's a PhD astronomy so I said why do you study astronomy because the brain is very difficult there are many neurons it's almost like a Galaxy so lucky or not many of neuroscientists are physicists definitely not uh poets for sure so you've you know in your presentation actually what you charted was really extraordinary story and it seems like it's only the Highlight VI right everything is a success but surely there are ones that Got Away surely there are some mistakes surely some regrets maybe can I ask you to share with the audience what are some of the things that you look back and say oh I shouldn't have done this well the the most difficult uh challenge for me when I was is I just have enough manpower there are more projects I want to do and secondly is my cost land cost labor cost so in EDB I have to be selected what are the industries I can bring here what I have to foro so therefore I came the idea maybe I can move some of these companies I cannot attract to my neighborhood so at least I can service them I can also Supply part so when I start that bottom industrial part the reason very simple I came J 86 by 1987 full employment the government slam me a worker a levy quarter so so I got a company at Thomson electronic we are making components uh devices for the TV but now your labor C okay okay produ the components I ship the bottom to sample that's how I surviv so Thompson Electronics surviv because as simply you know there's no better instrument than the eyes in text so the S test is very L int I went to sum electric they make all the wire HS for the automotive cars they ask me for 500 workers I say in Singapore 500 workers to do Automotive top so I mve the bottom so I took 250 Indonesian kids 12 years 18 18 years old 21 send him to Japan for 6 months second back for two months by the way they went to Japan with a Japanese government's approval on my letter of of such requests indan Minister could not get his authority I wrote to the minister of of Labor in Japan I need this worker to be train so tomorrow will to train them take care them 500 and they produce all the assembly so Singapore can never go to the assembly but the part and comp but time come to Singapore port from Singapore over the world so we still get services so what people don't realize botom depends on Singapore right not the other way around so there are industries that I really cannot do if I go to Pang now I have a factory down my Aerospace but is not having labor problem we produce parts for air bus and boing we have 1,700 workers there and still in manufacturing uh they labor tight so now now also had to bring in foreign workers and P same problem as us so now I create a new Factory in uh aaya and chur last year November I was in churri to create two more companies to take some of the work from Pang today so now I have 400 workers in in Thailand by 2026 when a new Factory is up I should have a th workers in Thailand so are there any industries that you regret any companies Industries they regret bringing or they thought well I shouldn't have brought them in well we try every industry except uh Casino by the way I was nearly involved with that lucky uh because you know even you asked to do Services what services can we do so one of the thing was uh tourism I live to tourism uh Financial Ms Logistics we can do it Casino was also China was be I remember we also went to Disney World try to get Disney to do a Disneyland here they ask 1,000 hectares I don't have 1,000 hectares so so many of this uh projects are quite challenging because land and labor so I would say in Singapore the resource constraint of Labor is a key constraint there's no sub that's why we must always push to higher value higher uh value added uh more automation you look our factories in Singapore J well automated we have only l in fact the last statistic I check was 12% of our labor force are in manufacturing and we produce a respectable 19 to 10% % of GDP most young oppon are not aware of that Hong Kong manufacturing share GDP 1% not many peopleware they have no M because all went to C Hong Kong is none so two months ago some friends from Hong Kong can you see me we're taking a set of Advisory board can you come and help us because they used to love a Singapore you all manfa what you do manufacturing their labor no manufacturing depends which part of the value chck what is Trum now trying to do just to try to kill the 54 uh ship act says look tsmc is going to come here because I use tariff there's no need to give money so America now is desperately trying to get manufacturing back that's get back but the key is that if they all Americans are thank God is Thursday not Friday you cannot have manufacturing if my industry is highly automated highly dependent on big machines the most important person for running machine besides the worker who's programming it and then repair maintenance people if the machine breaks down I'm dead so instead of buy one uh DMG machine which is a million dollars I buy three because the key problem of automation is maintenance Personnel the guy repairs a machine machines all break down no Machine Works forever so you need good Engineers you good maintenance people that's why in Singapore we are smart to have poly Technic people you you know when the machine breaks down they you are stuck especially in the industry that is high value High added Capital intensive you cannot afford to shut down so whenever I look at our factories in plan I always worry you are now technician to repair because the machines will break down and the machines cost a lot of money a million dollars in fact we bought six new machines for a factoring plan the machines didn't work they fly technicians from Germany spend months fixing it and I told my people don't pay the Germans ask them to fix it first finally work but show you you buy more Capital Equipment more maintenance if you buy electric car when a car doesn't work you have to run to Workshop Electronics gu is there so the more automated you are the more D you are the more dependent on repair people it literate and so therefore like it or not the skill set of young in a PO te are very important if you go to the hospital now all the MRI machines all the CT scans all run by young people and they all poly people they are obviously not philosophers they are poliy keeping the machines going so if you look at Medical Services go to the hospital I see a shma equipment you need good technicians good Engineers uh besides doctors in fact the doctor is one of two guys the rest of the hospital is the cost of Hospital bit now is $1 million one hosital B $1 million and when the machine doesn't work and you have a problem maybe we open up the floor to questions yeah yep uh we'll take a two or three questions at a goal and then you know we'll answer okay U maybe there first and then uh this gentleman there yeah no I think we have a question up up there right hi this is aliser here right at the back thank you so much for sharing the question I have is that just now as we hear about kidnapping all those around the region and singaporeans getting too comfortable waiting for vouchers only what do you think is the fate of singaporeans do you think that because we have been too comfortable with the policies government being very efficient that we are not adventurers to venture around outside of Singapore too tight back here to the BTO and we need to just go through the whole system in life what do you think will happen to singapor if we continue to be that way and what do you think we can do okay thank you one more question maybe this gentlemen yeah uh my name is Satya I am from a bank called SMBC uh Mr yo uh before I ask my question your advice on one bag is particularly relevant today postco because so many bags get lost uh my question is uh with regard to Johor Singapore sez you know I was particularly interested in the early part where you talked about how we are not dependent on services in the region but now it's obviously much more important to work in the region to grow economic output uh and Johor and and the Malaysian relationship is obviously uh has been a tenuous one um so from the economic growth point of view uh how do you think uh Singapore can make jss EZ a successful economic multiplier for Singapore okay thank you got it okay maybe one more question and then yeah uh that oh sorry that the gentleman there yeah and then just just hold on for the next round yeah hi um just two very short questions um one about if Singapore is going to move into more high value added sectors because it can't compete on labor costs then what's what is the industries that's going to um uh absorb Surplus employment so how do we deal with the problem of employment if we're going to move into industries that require less and less labor um and then the second question had is as I understand it from the history of Singapore EDB held a very Premier position as like the head of Singapore's developmental State and lots of the top brass came from EDB like yourself but now as the permanent Minister said with other Industries um taking for um and even places like imda and Mas even playing a developmental role what is the role of EDB today does it still hold that Central developmental role does it have to work with other uh development agencies as well thank you okay great maybe let's start with the first question okay kidnapping and are singaporeans too comfortable you know what we should do is that minist education should arrange for our secondary school kids to send to Cambodia Vietnam do a semester there the kids there are hungry know Singapore kids do not realize you go to Vietnam our Factor now now we have 18 Parts under Sam cour our chman there the V kids are very hungry so the diffic of Singapore G they always look at American model European model holiday Disney World you go to Vietnam they have no Disney World they are struggling when I first set industrial park there they all working very hard uh so the key is that maybe one way for Min education is prly send our students not to America send to our asan neighbors to see how people live there work there do their attachment there uh that's why I suggested to uh because I chair the N Business School uh business school I said want to get all your students going into a a Sting with some of our neighboring countries because our neighborhood is still a big gap with us and our young people they are more hungry and there's no other solution unless the parents uh take take away their pocket money on second question uh Joor Singapore s EZ the political difficulties minister of trade industry uh Li Jing Tong came to see me uh two months ago asking me what I can do with uh Singapore jeor zone so I told him if I were a jeor engineer and you pay me 4,000 R I come to Singapore get $4,000 Singapore dollars you think I will stay in jeor because the Gap is serious so I say really if you are to produce in joall I cannot pay them a Singapore salary unless say you joke with me why not pay them two3 so I say my Singapore engineer is 4,000 uh that convert to uh Malaysian currency about 12,000 regate MH so thean my Joo my P Engineers already paid 5,000 R so I told him it's not possible to do manufacturing there because you need unless it's pure labor assembly if you want to higher value and short labor I say the only industry I can see there is Education Health Care uh retirement homes jokingly services are area because that's the area look even healthare is not a minor thing because the healthare really good doctors nurses so for manufacturing is quite a difficult check okay data centers they now have approved 20 data Cent you know what data center power hungry water hungry and very few workers inside you you go to a data centers all computers all the wi is there you think cool the guy sit down there control station control make sure all the batteries are working the construction data center require workers the moment the constru sector is done the sector running very few jobs I sent an article around to some read you know to build a this Center require construction Engineers but once it's done very few people need it so your has approved more than 20 and they now they realize is oh better increase electricity rates on them right it's a fact because why should we subsidize unless you got Hydro power is cheap like in in Bhutan they tried with cryptocurrency they spend a billion dollars on because they got Hydro power generate this is just Bunch tons and tons of computer running it whether it's uh our friend from Nida chips they basic a computer set that almost like PC and they use a lot of energy and you need to cool you need good uh cooling system there but very few jobs so je my view is that really uh should Singapore hland without political application this make sense if I can live in je in fact I was telling the minister dep Minister once you RTS more of the Y people will will take the train to Singapore to work because our housing cost so high why want to live in Singapore if the train is about 30 minutes it makes more sense for JE people to live there and work here in fact also for Singapore to live there and work here unless hdb cool down the C it's a fact of life because I went to uh Forest City for they are having for 3,000 R per square foot a good quality one that's about only 1,000 s our now our Condominiums here are going for 3,000 square foot Singapore dollars so in Pang is different because Pang because we moved to p a long time my P Engineers are only 5,000 R they not complain because housing there is cheaper affordable but even 5,000 rate with labor type eventually have to go to 6 well 6,000 rate divid by 3 is 2,000 sing my Engineers here cost about 5,000 sing M so the Gap is very high I mean I go to jaw I go to Pang uh my Asma drug is $84 here I buy a pank I actually pay only about4 $32 so Singo you go and buy more drugs from they come from the same Factory they come from the same Factory it's true so I was very honest with him he he knows me quite well because I knew him was young he's not depy Minister D Chong I say if you really going to have Manufacturing in je it be a challenge unless you allow me more foreign workers right that means I got to do more of the labor type if you want a Jo engineer the Jo engineer will not stay there will come to Singapore take the RTS it's a fact of that so I'm being frank to him so uh fortunately he's a politician election he's the MP for that area isanda p is the MP there he won the election few times so he's worried about jobs I say most of Mia are working in Singapore here maybe what the fact we should all live in J and Singapore so maybe third question uh we're moving from uh know to a higher value added economy and so he's asking right what's the industry that's going to absorb all this Surplus employment as you know employment becomes manufacturing employment strength manufacturing employment the last statistic is less than 15% yeah 12% 12% so now most of singur are in services and as you know Serv productivity not very high it's quite tough to cannot auto mechanic and the reality is that we have to depend more domestic market so going forward I think we Chinese for government how to make sure that there's enough jobs for Singapore in the services sector Services as Medical Services Health Care Services uh teaching Services the other non for example in a in a restaurant restaurant business quite tough you see a lot of uh food and beverage company labor is tight cost are high they close so economically going forward is quite a challenge because you're now so dependent on domestic market and then the cost are high so we have a big challenge whoever is MP of the area better worry because it's a fact of life J try if we go to J now more and more traffic jam there to many vehicles going down because they can automate they can upgrade they use real people I eventually take our MTH employment of manufactur maybe down 10% mhm 10% when I was first work manufacturing employment of share manufactur 25 maybe 30 now we're down to 12 50% can even go down to 10% but Engineers more technicians less blue color worker you see if you look at my automated machines big machines the worker doesn't do anything just Program stand on there was a machine it's not and the whole place e ition is not dirty is clean so idea of factories are dirty is not true in fact the floor is spotless clean it's better than hospital because I cannot spill oil and 24 by7 fully aor in a sense it played to our strength because you know our population shrinking but also more educated so the challenge is politically how to find enough job this is not only Singapore you look at automotive industry in Japan in Germany the automotive industry is dependent on mechanical engineering distance engine cylinder transmission gearbox those all gone what is the electric car a golf cart the battery four wheels a motor in fact the EV car either AC DC to AC because motos run better AC one motor behind induction motor one in front the next St they have a motor for every wheel so your car can park sideways but so where are the jobs for more and more country will face a problem because if the EV Frankfurt of course uh sugat will be in trouble Nagoya will be trouble because all the mechanical industry are gone there's no reator in the car now so I can imagine any country that's why China is smart they jump straight to EV because All Electronics that's why electronic industry semiconduct very important in China today the EV car in China is not a car it's an entertainment system so the everything is Music Entertainment everything is there so now they have a new they have a new rare article they lot of graveyard because a lot of new EV car start up the company collapse you got the car but your software is outd you got a car electric car is a basically a computer on Wheels it's not your normal automotive engine right the the challenge is that the electric car is still more expensive than IC but byd have brought the price down to almost as good as 10,000 and they are focusing on share volume so if the electric the key cause of electric car is a battery the batter is coming down faster so a lot of changes China uses uh lithium iron phosphate battery the Western Country use maganese Cobalt different batteries and the Chinese batteries are supposed to be safer unless they switch so you look a key in electrical energ is chemistry semiconductors induction motor ACDC converters are standard and the Key software Entertainment System uh software in fact a good electric car there no to go to Workshop you can all the software downloaded it's just the apple as you update your software so electric car really will change the whole employment big change for us Germany and Japan now the key Advantage people are scared of called range worry range okay uh who has said byd say they aiming for 1,000 kilometers one charge that comes about but really most most of us in cities we don't need 1,000 kilometers from Jong to uh Changi is only about 40 kilm so really we are driving at most we about 100 kilm a day so there's no R for range anxiety but it's all meant for worry so now there's a grab more and more hybrid cars yep that's the only thing so worry them maybe the last question of this group uh does EDB still play a Central Development role that's well I hope so because someone has to bring you the bacon to Singapore uh you see EDB is different from tomasic GIC when you are GIC people come and kiss your hands please invest in me or EDB we have to kiss there it's a tough job and we are competing against I just had a zoom last night my Indonesian friends uh the new uh CIO Chief investment officer of Dan Tera so he asked me to zoom in at 10:00 you want to zoom to 12 say sorry I got 1 hour and they are trying to build up the so Ware fund uh P was fell us internet because I night because myself friends from us from Europe all zooming in to help them you know to me indes you worth chasing they quite Keen so I thought you were we have two Sovereign fund got GIC very different one invest in assets yeah one in equities and so on so trying to learn in fact they're supposed to come next week I say well you I'm free I join you otherwise so I get request for free advice I never charge Chong I didn't charge my Indonesian friends cuz I zoom so I don't have to travel I don't complain but when Chon come see me I'll give my advice so I come to a point I get unpaid give free advice hopefully EDB remains important yeah next round of questions gentlemen here is this okay yeah hi uh thanks Mr y thanks Mr CH uh my name is Ki I'm a I was a biophysicist then I changed to law uh so I'm my question is more technical um uh coning two technologies um one is uh quantum physics uh uh Quantum and the other one is uh nuclear okay so my first uh my first question is concerning Quantum Quantum uh as most technical people would know there is a step up concerning as as opposed to classical uh systems Quantum Computing as opposed to classical Computing so my question is given the different nature want to pick your mind on these questions given the different nature of quantum what kind of business models can we uh build around quantum to leverage on the technology that's one question question two is nuclear uh it seems to me that um my take away from this conversation is that uh Singapore needs uh industries that are very dense high density high value density uh Industries um so I think Quantum and tech and and uh nuclear are two of those Industries my question for for nuclear is this where do you think we can put our nuclear plants uh in Singapore uh given your previous experience uh doing petrochemicals in D Island and uh where can we source for all the all the you know inputs thorium all the different problem deals that's the question two third question is yeah sorry last question last question my my last question is what are your thoughts on the asan power grid thanks okay Quantum nuclear asan power GD someone else yep are are you asking question somebody there okay great oh there's a lady there's a lady there u i I've been Wai with hand for a long time so I'm going to try to grab I'll come to you soon after yeah maybe maybe the lady first since she's been waiting there for a while sorry I missed you hi uh I'm Irene ho I'd like to find out what you think about the problems facing Singapore in the future relating to what's been happening with the the uh Nvidia chips okay what kind of problems uh and it just pointed to me that there's something interesting going on and we are likely to get more of this kind of thing as the uh trading environment gets tougher okay great thank you this gentan thank you so I'm going to sneak in this question uh my name is Andre I'm a I'm a subscriber of your notion that manufacturing is important for the country so my question is on manufacturing if in the 1980s we were known to be cheaper and faster as our value proposition to the world in today's new world right what should Singapore's design principle be and value proposition to the world in manufacturing should we still be cheaper and faster is that still relevant or what should we be uh I think that that is a question thank you thank you maybe one last one this gentleman sir thank you for your sharing my name is uh W2 I've been spending the past 12 years between Singapore and West Joor uh may I have your concurrence that in order for Innovation to happen one has to break existing rules uh I've admired you for your past record in the art of breaking rules without getting into trouble so for the sake of the survival of the future of Singapore in my very non-educated opinion we need to break some rules we need to be more empathetic to Southeast Asia we need to be more multilingual and make more effort [Music] to understand stand and to speak Regional languages so with your very big influence in society and in the system uh what are your suggestions for us singaporeans to be able to go forward and be a step ahead of the competition uh because from my grassroot perspective in Peninsula Malaysia and in Singapore uh I find that the Malaysians are much more humanistic empathetic to close the deal and to make things happen unlike the many young singaporeans I see today thank you thank you okay let's go through questions quite quickly because we have 10 minutes left but maybe just uh command first on Quantum nuclear and then the asan power grid well recently uh Microsoft announced that they got a quantum computer running there's article on my table where the scientific Community disagree it they me claiming so nobody know but I think the AI move faster than Quantum Computing is a fact so a lot of the quantum is China is also work in Computing and they're quite expensive they're using CIT so still this is like uh holy challice of computing Quantum yeah so between AI I think AI can do faster because you can uh you don't have to be S Hardware demanding quum is quite Hardware demanding it's quite expensive yeah you have vied on nuclear your views on nuclear power no nuclear power Abu Dhabi they now going for small nuclear power plants small Nu plants in the sense 100 megawatt 200 megawatt so the future to them is dispersed rather than one big nuc Power Plant of 2,000 megaw and also in the say it's also safer so some countries are experimenting that not many of you are aware in 1970s uh T soon Hing F including myself many us were taking out physics because the Singapore government look at nuclear power in 1970s so I I I I was accepted by any to do physics RAM joh wased for physics H was phys Nuclear Physics uh things but there's no clinical power plant so most are unemployed but now in America nuclear fish is coming back in China they are producing 10 nuclear power plants per year France has 54 nuclear power plants Germany is hot L now so French sell to now the demand for nuclear power plant not the giant ones the small one is coming back so you are smart student nuclear engineering is back business again so what's your view on the viability of the Assan power grid well the aan power PL has been discussing for a long time the key is uh compatibility different systems you need to harmonize and standard so I don't know whether they can achieve that uh we are I think with us and J is possible Indonesia some people talk about to batam but you go to Jakarta not too sure because it's a physical uh constraints we are not one landmarks we are separate by water and every so not so so easy but idea going to small nuclear power plants is a possibility in fact we did in the 70s we look at Tong when I was M maybe put a power plant to come everybody's SC people in ch get fright but today is not the nuclear power plant smaller it's possible so you watch what the people are doing now in in the Middle East some countries doing it Abu Dhabi is doing it smaller ones and also the whole process of the uh the nuclear material being used so it will come but the the cost is high uh you can bring it down so it's at District cooling now can District power why not so whether we are will to experiment maybe we could put a small Nu power plant and our military Camp to go supply all the people in ch okay moving swiftly on next question is on Nvidia you know the recent Nvidia case and also the the fact that we are going to see a lot more export controls for chips yeah so how would that affect Singapore well inidia China constitutes 12% of its Market Revenue so inidia is now caught between the China and us and and although they downgrade the chip to H20 whatever but what is happening that the Chinese are doing their own chips Huawei is doing their own chips Alibaba own ships matter of time and they have the chip design they have smic the semiconductor industry of China so the more the American put a squeeze on China you force them to be independent if they are smart will sell them they can always cut P raise a price what the Chinese are not still people they have enough Engineers so where is fic with Huawei or Alibaba they will do it maybe not the fastest ship that's what de had done so in the reality D depends on China market so in a sense uh so I was told that D chin New Year went all the way to China to talk all the customers please buy my chip right don't forget Nidia is not a new company you've been around for a long time they were doing graphic chips for gamings all the chips for gaming people who sit on the spend hours so that become important in the AIA because it's all either training the chip or the chip so the is doing uh AMD track has not done well uh there are not many other countries I think other company in Nidia that's right yeah but what's the implication for Singapore I think the lady was asking well so far we allowed to buy uh hope hopefully we are some some people are called selling to Malaysia but if our companies can use the H20 or better chips I see no reason why we can't build up uh support the more more training and development it can be done so Singapore is still in the green card we are not on the black Le M uh now America tightening up but you know it makes no sense the more they tighten up the more the Chinese will do it yeah I'm quite sure they would do it I remember when Chi was prime minister I to come to Singapore with ch I said there two key Industries for China One semiconductor and two chemicals so I took to J Island I show you the semiconduct plant now in China has all the petrochemical themselves our petrochemical question semic they do it in fact when I was talking he was PM first was DPM PM I said why do you have 20 province buying the own semiconductor plant all day 20 Micron machines because in China there's no National policy every prob want to be king every prob wants to be a semiconductor King you know China is more competitive than America so 100 EV cars 100 EV cars most of are ding they eventually left how many EV cars are there America Tesla GM Tri uh for tribe and then uh R van D China is very competitive the problem is is a very wasted waste food system because everyone compete many SCS left behind but they will survive so in this in the in the Nida chip n's greatest threat is China not any other company in America not AMD even M next question manufacturing what's our value proposition is it still cheaper better and faster uh well we're no longer cheaper for sure uh the key in high you need talent so we can train now bright smart Singapore are not cheap and they can be productive they are not thank God it's Thursday okay survive that's my view and that's the government think that we should give everybody thank God is Thursday you know thank God is Thursday not a joke know because uh there was reading a report about tsmc TSM started the Factory phix Arizona they say all Taiwanese the American Engineers many they quit this is slave labor they want to have a thank God is thirsday the chines Taiwanese go down now now they got Tai restaurant Chinese school for the kids you know same industry is cap in sensive you need people to can run on shift manage the place on shift not Holiday Camp you know not Disney World but the value system must be there you look at our semiconduct you should visit the guys are working because it has to be run on three shift to four shift there's no such thing as uh we work Friday and then switch off so for Singapore is our course is a challenge uh our biggest challenge is not enough manpower we don't have enough Engineers quality Engineers we are worry so maybe you should go and kidnap some more uh all the principles of Singapore uh secondary school should go around hunting give scholarship to aan neighbor kids what's wrong we can afford four years of secondary education even six years education after that if I still 100 20 St are good enough we don't have enough kids in our schools now know some of schools are closing sh because no more babies so last question of this set right from that gentleman there he talked about breaking rules and whether you know the art of breaking rules right and what are some of the suggestions you have for Singapore to go forward well if we break rules must expect with SE so you are not afraid of being sex then you carry on you are scared of your job no man I work with Dr go how as far concern I can always walk out anytime the fact I don't believe I'm a civil servant I mean I'm not obled to stay walk out so I can do all the things and break provid I Break The Rules not my personal benefit I break the rules for the national gain for the mean they have gain the company I don't see any crime right because end of the day I trying to shortcut I give example when I came back in 76 i S4 Dr go asked me CIS sea Oda was 455 so I took over sa I automative engineering all the tanks were in the workshop there's no space how to work so I look across I saw two BR football field compliments of the British army so I last told the football field not much you he smile at me I didn't say anything at 5:00 call my officer put considered a wi one football field G right W you complain to him he laughes he go talk to I told we said look you don't need two full field to play most of the time football is growing grass so that's how sa became and I do have to pay for rent for the space p still okay uh we only have time for one last question here and I want to give one question to the uh people who are who are zooming in so maybe one question of this gentlemen uh thank you m um lexon from mind um so actually you talked about China you talked about us so I guess in your experience across all those many decades of traveling to these countries what in your view are the enduring comparative advantage of the countries you have been through the US China perhaps even regionally as well what is the comp comparative advantage of the enduring comparative advantage yes advantage of of engineering oh no uh of the various countries the US China whether or not based on your experiences traveling to these countries you feel that at a core this is just something that you know well we look at us and China uh China has a population that is four times five times depend educated population you go to American PHD programs most are not American Kids yeah you go to PhD program you look at MIT CCH most of them are Asians I remember when I was uh in the promoting semiconductors over IC industry Indians and Chinese so if you look at higher education the American kids are not very large number in PhD program it's a fact of life in China they have all the kids are 100% Chinese where they all the same quality but don't know they got lot of universities not all top grade sh numbers you see so it's it's a value system most Chinese student go to America to study engineering n then go to study philosophy and it's a it's a value system they say they are not interested in in politics but really that's the way is if you go to Taiwan many of kids are engineering is a fact of life so you look at America America and China is competing on talent and talent the disadvantage of China is homogeneous only Chinese America technically are smart they can steal for everybody I remember I visited uh uh I went to Toronto to visit Aerospace group there was uh 19 2019 I look at Aerospace know Canada is inter I meet all the engineers there I look at him you are from Iran I say I should know I've been in Iran Iran Engineers so if a country can steal people like America or can Canada they can always supplement replace that thank God people so Advantage America immigration of good value people is available yeah on the other hand China has own population so the strength ultimately is talent and there's no other no equipment you can buy for the same companies what comes is year last question from someone online maybe just to end us off can the Singapore economic story last for another 60 years that my answer is not my problem all right on that note let's give a round of applause thank you Mr Y and Mr Chin we come to the end of today's lecture we would like to hear your views on the event please click our link on the Facebook feed or scan the QR code on the screen to submit your feedback Mr Philip your's second lecture titled transforming Singapore's economy economy through research and development will take place on 27 March details will be on our website and IPS Facebook page we hope to see you then thank you [Applause] [Music]\n",

      "\"so it is my pleasure to welcome you to the IPS NAD lecture series by Mr Philip yo our 16 Sr NAD fellow for the study of Singapore today Mr y will be delivering his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation following his lecture Mr yo will take questions from the audience in the Q&A session the Q&A session will be checked by Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information development at the ministry of digital development and information before we begin please allow me to go over some housekeeping rules for the event thank you for joining us today at the auditorium please be reminded to switch your mobile phones to silent mode the lectur is being streamed live on Facebook it will also be recorded and uploaded onto our IPS website and our social media platforms later please subm me your comments and questions at anytime during the lecture through the Facebook comments for audience members here at auditorium today please step up to the mic during the Q&A session to ask your questions we also like to hear your views on the event there will be a link in the feed at the end of the lecture and a QR code which you can scan to submit your feedback director of ips janit deavon will now deliver his opening remarks director [Applause] please welcome everyone Philip yo our Sr norn fellow for this year is s generis that's Latin for Philip you're one kind one and I can do that's very difficult to introduce him so I will tell two stories which I heard from him first many years ago he may not remember the stor the stories are not exactly about him but about his mentor and Guru uh Dr goking s but it tells you a lot about him the first is a story uh both stories involved I think when you were in minda with him in the early years director what was it planning uh I can't remember what it was but anyway um one day at that time um we had pig farms in Singapore and the pig farms were causing u a lot of problems singaporeans were also complainers then and people complained about the smell of pigs but they also wanted to eat pork um and so how to solve this problem so Dr go calls Philip yo at then what 25 years old something like that uh very young man and calls him in and says look I've had an idea why do we get one of these disused super tankers you know buy them cheap put all the pics on the super tankers and sail the boat the ship out to South China Sea so he asked Philip yo to go and research this idea so Philip yo did and a few days later came back and says uh Dr go pigs don't sweat which is why they roll around in the mug you put them on a super tanker in the middle of the ocean they will all die of heat stroke you will have chasu but not pigs so that was the end of that idea another idea Dr go he reads in some magazine about Krill and how Krill contains very high protein and this story calls up again Philip and says there's this story Krill is very cheap actually the fishermen when they catch the Krill when uh they they throw the Krill away so why don't you go and collect all the Krill free of charge we don't have to pay and then we use it to feed the Army which this time around Philip didn't do sufficient research he did as he was told caught the grill and then we ended up and I remember this because I was in the Army at that time this was early' 70s Dr had just come back to defense from Ministry of Finance we had Crill for breakfast Crill for lunch Crill for dinner at the end of one month Phillip went to doct go and says enough you're going to have a revolt on your hands so that was the end of krill I tell these stories because they illustrate like no other story I've heard how our founding fathers were cranks and there is a definition of genius I can't remember who it was who defined genius as that zigzag flash of lightning in the brain and there is nobody who illustrated that more in the political leadership than Dr go um and nobody in the Civil Service who illustrated that more than Philip yo zigzag flash of lightning in the brain not all cranky ideas are accurate or good so you actually need the philipo in the first guys to go and tell the politician sir you're going to get Chu not pigs second idea you also need somebody like Philip yo to try out cranky ideas so this weird combination of the ability to speak truth to power and also willingness to try out crazy things is what produce the Singapore of today right you if you can't if you if you only have people who take the safe way the predictable way we wouldn't have got the Singapore of today now I have not read the remarks that were prepared for me because it's very difficult to capture philipo unless you've known him or worked with him neither of which I've done but certainly I'm old enough to remember the Philip yo who played such a huge seminal role um in the development of Singapore I won't summarize what he has to say um uh except uh to say that um you will hear plenty of evidence of the zigzag flash of lightning that's genius so without Much Ado please Philip thank you so much director ladies and gentlemen without further Ado I would like to invite Mr Philip yo to begin his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation Mr yo [Applause] please okay let me put out the first slide this slide is important for Singapore and is also for me from 1960 to 65 I was happy in HGI in the library in 6 1966 I went off to Toronto I came back in 70 as an Industrial Engineer so my whole career started from 1970 when I spent my first job other shot one man with finan was Ministry of Defense so I've been working with Ministry defense from 1970 which the same time as skill intensive 1970 to 1994 most people don't know that I was my payroll even was EDB was still in defense from 19 but i mov from EDB 86 1984 and I was always say what's important is that during my 1970 to 94 although was also evv all my work was industry defense industry I produced motor bombs M16 anti aircraft ammunition build warships rebuilt the Skyhawks so all my career has always been industry so very naturally when Singapore got in trouble at an EDB and EDB are continue the same uh economic role you can see the curve they we have to move to more and more uh particular Industries so in a sense if I look at my this calendar here this chart here is from 1970 to 2006 it's always economic so let me go to the next one the faces I think most sing is aware actually we took off only in 1970 the British left Singapore in 19697 and my first job in defense was to create jobs for Singapore is retrenched by the British Army and that's how I end up building up a defense industry to create jobs for sing for so next phase was Capital intensive for which is important that we have to go into more and more uh labor constraint for unemployment to almost full employment by the 1980s and technology which are continue so my whole career is from the 70s to the 1990s to 2000 now where we are today everybody knows that so I won't emphasize on that now this is important chart when I took over EDB 86 I was a b member of Ed 82 to 85 I was a pump sa in defense I was also chairman computer board defense industry so I was there so I realized in EDB in 1986 how can we contribute the GDP of Singapore at that time uh we had about trying to aim for 25% share of GDP which a tough number and at least 20% of employment of Singapore must be industry but today you look at it employment of singap in Industry today is about 12% 15% but our allp put is HS higher our manufacturing sector is hard to keep at 25 because labor constraints to really look at Singapore 15% of our employees of singapor are working for Industries to produce 20% of GDP it's very significant very few singapor are add that most of our industries that are manufacturing are export there is no local market it 85% of economy is Services which is domestic maybe for Logistics or Ship Repair shipping most of industries that we have sample is that we have less than 15% of population in manufacturing we producing 19% to close to 20 depend on the year of the GDP what's interesting to look at the numbers I ask for breakdown Electronics multinational chemicals multinational bom medical multinational you look at the share of the value added very high I look at Precision Engineering transport G these are more local companies the value is low so from this two data you can see that the multinational companies contrib a very large percent of economic sector and also they give jobs to the local Precision Engineering and uh and bi medical General manufacturing so we need to that combination why do we push for manufacturing I remember I had a long dinner Mr with manufacturing I don't depend on my neighbors if I try to sell services to my neighbors they will never buy so what they have done is manufacturing ski for us to get out of Singapore and drct go play a very important part when I came back from Toronto in 1970 my first job was trying to escape the PSC chairman PSC here because they need offer me a job for one month I applied for a job with a company called L Industries L industry like Texas was one of the semiconductor companies that Singapore so my first job offer offer me as a engineer Industrial Engineer with industry the PSC say sorry you can't you go you're bonded so I stay on then I complain uh how about EDB uh you also cannot go because EDB is actually bought for two month so two job offers the industries rejected rejected how about going to the Ministry of Finance I end up in finance for one month after one my complain is not engineering job uh doing budget work oh they're looking for assist engineer and me they have so that's it so I been there all my own free will now what you can see in Singapore that we really mov when I first joined 1970 came back Singapore was making a magnetic CES any of here magnetic memory CS put a wire through that's how we did very low value but create a lot of jobs and Singapore create a lot of jobs so then we going to next so today we are down more balance unlike many countries around Singapore we are not dependent on one sector we we actually grown I explain the share Precision Engineering which makes a lot of key parts for the D drive electronics and semiconductor we still have a semiconductor industry which is important by the way I set up Charter industry chter Semiconductor in 87 and the same year as tsmc unfortunately tsmc at the full support of the government Singapore government says Liv to multinational that's what happened uh energy chemicals are there and you have the Aerospace Aerospace so if we look at Singapore we are more Diversified than Taiwan Taiwan is only one industry semiconductor we are more balanced fi and partly because unlike Taiwan most of the companies we have are multinational in Taiwan most the company are local if I remember years ago when I to Taiwan Taiwan has a tari of 30% Singapore no tari tyan has a sizer population we don't have so in a sense un like Taiwan uh we have to depend on multinational Investments That give us what Dr go call they bring us technology uh they bring us production know how and the most important is management and markets and Dr go is a very key person in in the defense in the economic of EDB uh when I was in uh in defense he was still involved in the defense industry was also created by Him to create jobs for singaporeans most of you are not aware I involved in amation tanks should produce the first cette for the Navy unit 87 uh rebuild a skyw so all this was because to create jobs we have gone through that phase now everybody knows this now our industry because of our population size we have to constantly upgrade there's no way for us to uh take on labor intensive jobs so you look at transformation that way now we have the done everything by multinational and uh in semiconductors we done it but the key industry we had in the early 70s was a semiconductor long before anybody appreciate long before besides own Ship Repair and as far concerned the semiconductor industry has given us very Brad P the same skills are here today we don't produce uh one particular company but we have many more companies here uh this is it we are in chip design We Are W for fabrication we produce all the this year we do assemble test now assemble test is the most labor intensive so we move when I was EDB help encourage them to move to Pang so you see a lot of the assem test in P actually from Singapore same the people there because we use pan as our more of the labor and we focus on upgrade so Singapore and pan has a very unique relationship unfortunately sing J doesn't have the same let me go on to here okay 1985 uh I was still defend froms so uh I was asked by Minister of Finance that time TR industry ton can you be a chairman of skill Development Fund so Al the problem so September 19985 when I still in defense I took a job job of chairman SK fund then I realized economy was really sinking so can you please come over it be halftime in defense halftime from January 86 I say well I try M I give up I just move over remain as a pump defense and ODP full-time in Jan 86 you look at the data here this are first recession remember manufa is a very key component in 1986 the employment is more than 20% of Singapore population at one time was more than 25 but to is gone down it was a big shock to us that's what I did now EDB has never advertised in the whole history from 1961 to 1986 so when I Tred to Market this advertisement with the Wall Street Financial Times the ministry of trade industry says sorry got no budget so I complained my Minister says no budet why not use some of your reserves so I had to dig with own pocket and run this advertisement and this advertisement I went around to see my good friends in America these are all wellknown companies some are still around and they sign off uh and this was the first time we realized we have how to promote Singapore because at that time one the kid problem on 85 recession was our share our cpf was 25% your contribution 25% by the company at 50% cpf you killed all the companies so 85 recession I always believe is self created self-inflicted anyway after a retire from EDB in 2010 some my fellow uh colleagues sign this off for me as my reputation are working anyway it's a joke now our recovery was good we push for more and more high value production especially trying to move away from uh low value added industry of Refinery the services sector we took on three new sector it sector business headquarters uh Medical Services I try to promote to and uh these were the services we try because in manufacturing I can automate I can produce higher productive in Services harder so my rule of time easier to upgrade manufacturing and to provide services unless the services of high value and next was how to diversify the regional market and those are thing let me take the chemical sector Singapore has been a refining Center over 100 years but the value added is very low we produce refined products for gasoline for kerosene that's it and we are selling these products to the region the low value add is very low so the key constraints was how do we uh at create more jobs the only way to create more jobs in the chemical sector is to go down down the Christmas tree go down to more and more products so came idea I I need to go down the petrochemical route I need land and land is not so easy available in Singapore in fact I went to look at Sosa Island and then the tourist was horrified they're going to steal the island by anyway Sosa island is too small but only 400 450 hectares not very big what I wanted was 3,000 hectares very ambitious because my idea if I I have 3,000 Hees I can have at least three petrochemical comp complex I can produce 3 million tons eth every petrochemical complex is one ethine million tons so minimum three but still four or five to create mass at the same time I want the chemic industry to be link to each other so one a produce something goes to B produce go to C so it's integr itself is is almost a full cluster rather than stand load and this idea was to create and most and secondly one on the island where nobody lives I went to Rotterdam I went to Houston I saw all the houses around them every now there's a fire so I said know the only way is to put in my Island so I asked the government for a budget of 7 billion they nearly fainted so usually I thought okay we start with 500 900 eventually today we have 3,200 hectares that's almost 8,000 acres of land is still available but the chemical entry is changing so now we have to look for what else can we do so I'm spending time with some my EDB colleagues what industries can we put in J Island besides the petrochemical complex now this is good example of anyway Skip One now this is how we refine uh you see refining is low value added now we are down to Specialty Chemicals Petr chemical is there so EDB collect are chasing special chemicals more high value lower volume with good prices and they dependent but at the same time what else what else can we do so the big challenge for Singapore is how to keep on moving ahead because the key challenge for us how to remain linked to the world to manufacturing not just service in the region so now we come to what we have now what most of you are not aware when I try to go down to Farmer production we have no land so I asked my EDB colleagues can we reclaim some more land so from near the shipyards in j where called the to area I asked them to help to reclaim and they reclaim about 300 280 hectares so all the farmer Industries all there and they allocated they share the same utility they same all the needs in the sense they already compact if you go to any farmer company in America us is one company here one company there all SC country here is all P to do today we produce eight of the top uh biological drugs in the world we don't own them uh we produce the drugs for all the companies we have no generics generics are India China Thailand we are all propi because the margins are high but it's a industry that we have packed together and we have trained people for the industry every time there's a new drop we hope they bring it to Singapore so today we have a good these are all the companies here all brand names unfortunately we don't have a local names uh these are all International names and these are names you do not see in Taiwan for sure right now in Hong Kong now and we continue to grow we have to continue grow because uh the biomedical industry biological Industries are very most of drugs are for cancer and other uh difficult diseases but on the other hand the value is very high every time there's a new drug we try to bring them to Singapore EDB colleagues and their job bring here why every drug has a patent life of 17 years the first seven years plus is clinical trial and there's no Revenue when the drug is approved by FDA the St is 10 years only so when I bring them to Singapore we give them the support in the tax holiday they got 10 years of pure cream beyond that somebody will do a generics harder to do with cancer drugs but that's it now all those things we have done most of the sing now I'm no longer EDB I spend my time needling them says are you worried so I thought my good I can ask uh Kong to come and worry us yeah Kong do serve as MDB and as you know EDB is is a place where we travel with one suit case you got five shirts and four trousers Monday to Friday no checking luggage you want check luggage you can join another Ministry yeah so our let me just put this way our operating environment has really changed we all read in the news we have a geopolitical we have trade tariffs the tariffs are going serious we might be CAU it tax incentives our tax incentives no longer be useful and just Big Challenge we have to modify but we are lucky we are in a region aan region I always tell my col it's important region that most of us better learn the speak besides manding Bahasa very young people don't understand that because our neighborhood is still uh lots of Malaysia Indonesia combined together can give us about only 300 million competition for talent the biggest challenge for Singapore last year we had only 35,000 babies I said so we need to go and kidnap and when I was Ed I specialize in kidnapping I take young kids from the region Vietnam India China bring them in young bring them young at 15 you can indoctrinate them they grow up to be singaporeans they bring over 21 they will not be singaporeans so if you really want to grow Singapore KET the best and brightest from the region free education Singapore from seary to jc2 then you got a new Singapore ready made right and ai ai is an area where I was just reading an article I sent to a k you know dips it sounds very simple what's happening now is not dpck they apply dips in every industry the key is not AI the key is how to use it depends on the industry whether I can use it in drug development I can use it in manufacturing I can use in banking so the key is that AI will possibly change the biggest difficulty was that AI I also change employment so employment is another area where I really can for example there a doct I say know when you go for X grade you got depend on the X-ray uh technici take a look but lot of the AI can do of the mundan work which means the demand for skill set will change the only industry that safe are medical services are still safe you a doctors you need nurses every other industry whether they accounting auditing all other Str now nobody knows how bad but it will be happening and these are the key risk so for every if I were the Singapore business Federation will be worrying these are the issue that we have to worry uh how are we going to because nobody knows Mr Trump has been Office foress 100 days already and we all in a spin uh last day I was watching the speech uh we call call reciprocal tariff if we put a t 10 % you put 10% so you going to change a LW you know America for example Mexico and Canada all exports to United States is tar free now he want slam 25% he just get a retrie for one month for the automative industry because automated is well integrated between Canada us and Mexico there a lot disruption uncertainty uh I think politically will be a challenge for young uh government because who knows uh where where we are going but key for us is Singapore Singapore has to be prepared we have to look at advantages of each of these sectors what else can we do so in a sense uh looking forward our EDB officers we have to start thinking how how do we navigate the changes now this is I emphasize to my colleagues uh I work a lot with Indonesia uh started B industrial state 1990 by 1992 was Full Employment I moved to Vietnam today Vietnam uh vsip was my project 94 now there are 18 parks in Vietnam by the same participation I started bang Park 1995 96 16 or know today we are in Bangalore chenai Hyderabad Pune and Bombay so I look at Vietnam we have our uh Mark there in India we have a mark indes a mark China is we have W and so we have to look at maybe we can take advantage position Singapore to take advantage of our neighborhood which means we must accept Singapore to get out of comfort of Singapore and go and manage companies there not just sit at home uh waiting for government vouchers now I mention about Talent this is important thing so I was studing uh in ch can you please go and kidnap because America is cutting the ni budget uh my son is a victim there normally for every dollar research you get another 30 cents for supporting a lab uh electricity water so ni cut down to 15% which means you I a professor I Let Go students and Lego it's quite difficulty for them wor they announc that they'll freeze all probation officers anyone in the US government who a probation means a fresh officer your job is gone it should be way you should Tak in the young ones maybe ret return some of the mid Med managers but that's the way it does so many our young PhD students today are job so if I were the Singapore government I go there and kidnap all of them yeah and they it deep s is not just an eight I it's the same way as we apply it throughout I remember when I set Singapore commun system in 1980s applying SCS computer science to all the manufacturing and those days I was using computers many computers in the same way deeps and the similar whether from Alibaba will have great impact on manufacturing and services so I hope our people are churning out I've just read article that China has more than three 300 colleges set up to train people in AI not all succeed but they produce and a day there will be a critical mask that will come up so maybe ask K to come and entertain us now [Applause] thank you so much uh Mr yo for your lecture for those watching the lecture on Facebook please submit your comments and questions through the Facebook comment box for audience members here please step up to the mic to ask your questions may I now invite Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information and development at the ministry of digital development and information to start the qna session thanks very much thanks Mr y uh I don't think we need the mics Okay so so uh as you can tell Mr y's style is very Breezy and quick and you know because I think he wants to get down to discussing and to having a great debate with you guys so before we start can I just ask set some house rules first I'll keep the questions short I know many people will be will want to make comments uh just make a short comment more importantly questions so that Mr yo can answer uh secondly we try to keep to the content of the speech really on economic strategy there's a lot more that you can ask him later but let's focus on economic strategy transformation and maybe his time at uh EDB uh I'm as as you would know know I had the honor of actually in a sense following in Mr y's footstep in EDB and one of the things I always remember is when I came in there was only one rule that uh was there throughout which is that trolley back rule uh everywhere you go you carry One Trolley back no matter where you go no matter whether it was a twoe trip no whether no matter whether you gone to Davos and you had a brave minus 20° C it was a One Trolley back Rule and we even maintained it to this day I don't know about DB now I imagine it's the case uh not because we no we are holding on to it because I think it's a symbol of what EDB stands for and what Singapore's economic transformation is about right we stay lean we stay mean we always hustling we always hungry and we always chasing and we got to move fast uh maybe you want to explain why is why did you Institute the one back trolley rule well I I will I arrive in New York on a Sunday arrest Monday morning I wake up early breakfast I leave a hotel one back because we are going to several cities if you want to check your luggage goodbye to your luggage because you change planes and then there delay so hang out to your luggage for dear life one lug so the ru is five shirts four pants B that's for guys now how about for women ladies Now ladies have to roll up their dresses and sausages because otherwise you know the ladies not smart they roll dresses and simple and always dress we only one coat there a coat you wear so for lady officers who Trav we have to learn the same way one now it sounds a bit cruel because I can wake up in New York and I go to uh B another Chicago I go to kooko to look at Del's equipment under the car then I fly to San Francisco so I get 26 27 hours Advantage mhm my working hour is 27 hours because I moved from New York by time I reach California 11:00 I actually have 27 so that's a way and the other key reason is that we have no time for laundry you do laundry you lose your laundry so you make sure you got five shirts four pants five underwear for sure and five socks yeah and the lady officer adjust to be fair oh my lady when I first join EDB 86 there only five lady officers surely CH a few of people but 50% of ladies so I think I'm better diversity than Mr Trump yeah we always say that the ladies in EDB are always uh one of a kind because they are the ones to volunteer for all the difficult assignments like like going to Mumbai going to you know China okay great so maybe let's launch off from where you ended because you know we are now in a new phase uh when you join EDB in manufacturing uh you know this you could argue that actually the you know the conditions were very rip for the manufacturing takeoff right uh globalization mnc's were expanding yeah in fact just a factoid for you right when the semic you know semiconductors are being talked about quite a bit right now actually the semiconductor industry was one of the first Industries to Offshore off offshore within less than 10 years 7 eight years from Silicon Valley they offsh short first place they offshot because it was too and you know Mr yo talked about the assembly and testing part of it which was really the low value connecting wires the first place they offshot was actually Hong Kong because back then American workers were paid $2.50 an hour Hong Kong 25 cent therea came Taiwan 19 cents yes and guess where Singapore was yeah third in theow third in line 11 cents and that's really how we started and today is a completely different story right if you think about it sure we are probably the most most expensive you compare Hong Kong doesn't really have a manufacturing industry but no Taiwan shenen of course right we are also land is very expensive but more critically now we have carbon as a constraint not plus you have tariffs you have a retreat from globalization you have even the prospect of us and China uh contest so do you still believe that manufacturing is the way to go and if so what are the areas that Singapore can comp sure well in semiconductor up to Mr Biden's time and Trump's recently Us lost all conductor other than Intel AMD for example I used to know them so their Foundry in Dr Germany to Global foundaries IBM in fish uh fish kill upate New York I used to visit them saw The waer Foundry also to Global foundaries who is global Foundry uh Abu Dhabi so Abu Dhabi MD uh mad asked me Mr you we want to put all these companies together in Singapore we also bu semiconductor your company to create Global foundies I said well if you buy Dron Singapore and fish New York and Singapore what's your plan we want to build a waer fat Foundry in Abu Dhabi obviously I kept quite a laugh see he never succeeded but I warn them that Global Foundry in this business you must continually invest you cannot stop so I joking teased the CEO mad I say semiconductor Foundry is having a fence mistress very expensive to maintain that's what happened you look at uh TSM every year he has to invest fur F from five Micron to four Micron treat so it's a very challenging so either you have the money or you have the skill if you don't have the skill for example uh tsmc set a factory in Now Phoenix Arizona they have to export 500 Taiwanese there engine and don't forget and semiconductor industry is a 24 by7 there's no such thing as a thank God is Thursday which is American culture yeah after the earthquake straight away the Taiwanese engineer went went to fix we visit a semiconductor plant in Taiwan s gone they even have doet trees nearby because you are working on Shi three Shi or four Shi you want to have t is Friday you cannot build manufacturing semiconductor and that's why I'm very optim pessimistic that America was suceed Intel is now for sale uh Brock C is looking at Intel and then Trump squee uh T can you please buy The Foundry of Intel so the company the biggest reason why Intel is in this back position because when Apple came out iPhone in 207 he used Motorola chips intel was not interested then Apple switch to a chip arm chips are one designed by British group there's no uh it phone that use Apple phone that uses Intel chips they stuck at PCS and desktop computer so Intel lost it the key fit of future key fit for Intel failing was 207 they didn't want to produce the chip for the phone was the biggest mistake I thought is small value today in everything that we have in the car electric car your home vir is semiconductor semiconductor is more available to us today than anything else you look at electric car the key is a battery is chemistry the battery is a DC so when you charge the car you must charge DC when the car will have to convert from DC to AC to control the the induction motor that control the wheel the semiconductor chip the energy management is semiconductor that's it so lucky or not semiconductor today so perect so Americans now realize the so every country now in the world are trying to have the old own National semiconductor Japan is trying to do the same so in Singapore as far we concerned if we can find our Niche we can stay that it but we need good Engineers a good engineer we train we need to have I remember when 19 when I got Su to be at my empty I bought him back from New York and I say I want to build 25 wer F he nearly fainted why 25 W for f needs a lot of water electricity is one water water has no substitute electricity I can use diesel can petrol and what have you or wind so 25 wer fat require lots of water so s say yeah we cannot talk to Pub they will never agree so we came up Idea new water new water is actually edb's idea if I cannot get water I have to recycle although s promote you can drink it but don't drink it well the Recycled water is pure no impurities you one more water so that is important for deionized water and semiconductor so energy intensive water intensive so that's why in Singapore now we have a sizable semiconductor we are now B uh number three and we produce a lot of common parts that goes to everywhere most of our chips now go to Automotive EV so most singapor don't know that all the chips that we produce are really we don't do SML test all ship it out we do the components it goes up we have the we do the casting we do the shape the design and then it goes up but the thing that most Singapore don't see a because it's all in jurong they only know AER Road they know uh so Singapore do not know that out in j under DTC that's where the export of Singapore is that's where the job is and don't forget the multinationals make a lot of money they keep the money in Singapore Banks that's something but not that's why the doctor created the US dollar because all the mountain at one time G motor was here I remember they oh Mr we have about 500 million dollar Us in Singapore why Singapore is safe place they make their money get tax H they keep their money here everybody is happy yeah but you know so that's really I mean kudos to you and the team right you've really created some engines of growth right you have Electronics you have chemicals and bio Biomat but if you you know if I when I was at EDB if I get a penny for every time someone ask me so what's the industry of the future actually my answer I have no answer yeah maybe you have an answer for us so what do you think as you you know now yeah we should be focusing on what industries should well any day you have to make a product but more and more of the product requires much more software so even if I do a electric car the battery indu the ACDC converter the induction motor I still need the software to do the chip management so it's not just Hardware alone so we even really want to build you need to build more and more software people because a lot of the systems have become it's just like using uh dips does the uh the training of the chip buying all your data but the key is inference in in in the AI chip is you train with a database Ste people's information but then you have to use it to infer so the inference challenge is there so in the same way Singapore must find way to do the inference job uh and basically know how the key constraint to software is Talent is people intensive so unless we get uh population increased by more than 35,000 babies I have a choice I like to recruit another 10,000 50,000 kidnapping everybody here because the software is is good intensive we can't survive just on own 35,000 babies makes no sense uh if I were in the government I say I going kidnap or K I was with in Hanoi uh was we when Mr was sick and myself and him and and his s so and we he gave us talk to all the Communist leaders of vet government they asked him to give a talk after a talk uh and then we had dinner with the all the Deputy Prime Ministers and one Mr Lee Phio steals our people because I brought in 500 50 kids from Vietnam SE three I PID for all the SE three to jc2 but one condition every student that comes to sing Under My scholarship AA must a and every subject so they thought J I say well I using my money and you are smart kids there no reason why you cannot get a and have a good life and to prove the point the first batch brought 100 I sent 10 of them back they message got true so compare the Ministry of Education I'm a harder guy because my believe if you know to balance your time you can work hard and still have a life no excuse and they all did well so so the vietnames came here uh students from India China all they came here it well I interview one girl uh father is a farmer in scai or Cai every morning she wakes up at 5:00 4:00 take the school bus pick up M around they collect different kids they reach Singapore School 7:00 from b 1 to a Lev every year perfect score why not so I give a scholarship bachor PhD now Singapore I need to K more of those kids I went to Penang uh chief minister L Waring Please Don't Steal My People so he he had a big ceremony said Philip I got one boy and one girl the highest students with a level malan a Lev so there and there I offer a scholarship one of the boys the girl the father want to S the us so I took the boy it came to Singapore do physics and us I subsidized the schy to one of my companies so if I were running government kidnapping is a key function so if I were to follow up on this and ask you a more sensitive question so if I'm a young Singaporean I'll be very worried now because there be so much competition all this kidnapping of people now what do you say to the young Singaporean you see well uh K my good friend my son's complain you bring all the Vietnamese kids and our JC give me a hard time why they hungry why can't Singapore kids compete with them you know they very kids come here they stay in the doet Tre I put n High all so yeah from Monday through Friday in school Saturday Sunday stay in the D studying if Singapore cannot compete it's their fault I mean ultimately because these kids are really hungry my first patch I first took in in SGI International the first patch I have to sell 208 206 so I gave away the first IB certificate to 54 of them who was the top student my Vietnamese scholar all eight subject five prizes he came to Singapore the first year could not speak English in fact I remember I brought Tama to meet us so Tama asked the girl say the first year I was crying every day but they learn the key factor that drive these people is hunger if Singapore kids are not hunger good luck to them I don't mean a very good politician so if you were a young student because there are a couple of them in our mid today yeah what would be your advice for them in terms of what to study you know you talk about AI right AI is going to take our jobs right so what would you advise them to do well lucky or not it's easier to study a heart science or engineering and can always learn soft subjects as engineer I can read philosophy I can read economics I can read history not the other way around so by right you have a certain core of in fact some us universities got this liberal study they're not liberal they got science engineering and they have human build around it we are pure Humanities unless you become a journalist or writer stuff so in a sense you like it or not you have to take some good maths physics uh chemistry and then you can do the soft subject so really we look education is good to have a hard and soft combination uh purely sof I don't see how the guy who has a heart science can always pick up softw subjects so if education system we should have fundamentals of math physics in America for medical students because they have do a bachelor degree to apply to medical school they must have physics you don't have physics you cannot do engineering you don't have mathematics you cannot do so basic is mathematics and physics chemistry you can learn biology can read uh philosophy can read too so lucky or not the education must have core of hard core in the center and a soft so you want the all arounded person a person who got philosophy history but you need the good Sciences so an educ system that is purely liberal all the way I don't know how it going to survive MH and in Harvard bus school I was there we have three C of students in our class I was there in 7476 35% are Engineers a business school another 30% are business studies and undergraduate and other remainder are the philosophers boys so when it come to do number crunching the poor liberal arts English guys are lost it's not their fault because like you're not in the business school you have to crunch numbers you got to do projection and financial analysis so when I get anyn report like this I can read very fast I look at the numbers and then say where the compan is going for them they look at where where's the Poetry where's so we used to dist our Li and we used to sit down and help them because when it come to writing they're very good so I ask can they help write the case studies for us so you need a combination of the three groups of people people who are numerical people are also literal and hopefully a Balan education so a good education system must have hard and soft subjects so if I were you I would take a hard one because easier to learn soft subjects why it's hard to do the so a good maths uh good physics are fundamental and I remember I met some people were you know scientists and what's a PhD astronomy so I said why do you study astronomy because the brain is very difficult there are many neurons it's almost like a Galaxy so lucky or not many of neuroscientists are physicists definitely not uh poets for sure so you've you know in your presentation actually what you charted was really extraordinary story and it seems like it's only the Highlight VI right everything is a success but surely there are ones that Got Away surely there are some mistakes surely some regrets maybe can I ask you to share with the audience what are some of the things that you look back and say oh I shouldn't have done this well the the most difficult uh challenge for me when I was is I just have enough manpower there are more projects I want to do and secondly is my cost land cost labor cost so in EDB I have to be selected what are the industries I can bring here what I have to foro so therefore I came the idea maybe I can move some of these companies I cannot attract to my neighborhood so at least I can service them I can also Supply part so when I start that bottom industrial part the reason very simple I came J 86 by 1987 full employment the government slam me a worker a levy quarter so so I got a company at Thomson electronic we are making components uh devices for the TV but now your labor C okay okay produ the components I ship the bottom to sample that's how I surviv so Thompson Electronics surviv because as simply you know there's no better instrument than the eyes in text so the S test is very L int I went to sum electric they make all the wire HS for the automotive cars they ask me for 500 workers I say in Singapore 500 workers to do Automotive top so I mve the bottom so I took 250 Indonesian kids 12 years 18 18 years old 21 send him to Japan for 6 months second back for two months by the way they went to Japan with a Japanese government's approval on my letter of of such requests indan Minister could not get his authority I wrote to the minister of of Labor in Japan I need this worker to be train so tomorrow will to train them take care them 500 and they produce all the assembly so Singapore can never go to the assembly but the part and comp but time come to Singapore port from Singapore over the world so we still get services so what people don't realize botom depends on Singapore right not the other way around so there are industries that I really cannot do if I go to Pang now I have a factory down my Aerospace but is not having labor problem we produce parts for air bus and boing we have 1,700 workers there and still in manufacturing uh they labor tight so now now also had to bring in foreign workers and P same problem as us so now I create a new Factory in uh aaya and chur last year November I was in churri to create two more companies to take some of the work from Pang today so now I have 400 workers in in Thailand by 2026 when a new Factory is up I should have a th workers in Thailand so are there any industries that you regret any companies Industries they regret bringing or they thought well I shouldn't have brought them in well we try every industry except uh Casino by the way I was nearly involved with that lucky uh because you know even you asked to do Services what services can we do so one of the thing was uh tourism I live to tourism uh Financial Ms Logistics we can do it Casino was also China was be I remember we also went to Disney World try to get Disney to do a Disneyland here they ask 1,000 hectares I don't have 1,000 hectares so so many of this uh projects are quite challenging because land and labor so I would say in Singapore the resource constraint of Labor is a key constraint there's no sub that's why we must always push to higher value higher uh value added uh more automation you look our factories in Singapore J well automated we have only l in fact the last statistic I check was 12% of our labor force are in manufacturing and we produce a respectable 19 to 10% % of GDP most young oppon are not aware of that Hong Kong manufacturing share GDP 1% not many peopleware they have no M because all went to C Hong Kong is none so two months ago some friends from Hong Kong can you see me we're taking a set of Advisory board can you come and help us because they used to love a Singapore you all manfa what you do manufacturing their labor no manufacturing depends which part of the value chck what is Trum now trying to do just to try to kill the 54 uh ship act says look tsmc is going to come here because I use tariff there's no need to give money so America now is desperately trying to get manufacturing back that's get back but the key is that if they all Americans are thank God is Thursday not Friday you cannot have manufacturing if my industry is highly automated highly dependent on big machines the most important person for running machine besides the worker who's programming it and then repair maintenance people if the machine breaks down I'm dead so instead of buy one uh DMG machine which is a million dollars I buy three because the key problem of automation is maintenance Personnel the guy repairs a machine machines all break down no Machine Works forever so you need good Engineers you good maintenance people that's why in Singapore we are smart to have poly Technic people you you know when the machine breaks down they you are stuck especially in the industry that is high value High added Capital intensive you cannot afford to shut down so whenever I look at our factories in plan I always worry you are now technician to repair because the machines will break down and the machines cost a lot of money a million dollars in fact we bought six new machines for a factoring plan the machines didn't work they fly technicians from Germany spend months fixing it and I told my people don't pay the Germans ask them to fix it first finally work but show you you buy more Capital Equipment more maintenance if you buy electric car when a car doesn't work you have to run to Workshop Electronics gu is there so the more automated you are the more D you are the more dependent on repair people it literate and so therefore like it or not the skill set of young in a PO te are very important if you go to the hospital now all the MRI machines all the CT scans all run by young people and they all poly people they are obviously not philosophers they are poliy keeping the machines going so if you look at Medical Services go to the hospital I see a shma equipment you need good technicians good Engineers uh besides doctors in fact the doctor is one of two guys the rest of the hospital is the cost of Hospital bit now is $1 million one hosital B $1 million and when the machine doesn't work and you have a problem maybe we open up the floor to questions yeah yep uh we'll take a two or three questions at a goal and then you know we'll answer okay U maybe there first and then uh this gentleman there yeah no I think we have a question up up there right hi this is aliser here right at the back thank you so much for sharing the question I have is that just now as we hear about kidnapping all those around the region and singaporeans getting too comfortable waiting for vouchers only what do you think is the fate of singaporeans do you think that because we have been too comfortable with the policies government being very efficient that we are not adventurers to venture around outside of Singapore too tight back here to the BTO and we need to just go through the whole system in life what do you think will happen to singapor if we continue to be that way and what do you think we can do okay thank you one more question maybe this gentlemen yeah uh my name is Satya I am from a bank called SMBC uh Mr yo uh before I ask my question your advice on one bag is particularly relevant today postco because so many bags get lost uh my question is uh with regard to Johor Singapore sez you know I was particularly interested in the early part where you talked about how we are not dependent on services in the region but now it's obviously much more important to work in the region to grow economic output uh and Johor and and the Malaysian relationship is obviously uh has been a tenuous one um so from the economic growth point of view uh how do you think uh Singapore can make jss EZ a successful economic multiplier for Singapore okay thank you got it okay maybe one more question and then yeah uh that oh sorry that the gentleman there yeah and then just just hold on for the next round yeah hi um just two very short questions um one about if Singapore is going to move into more high value added sectors because it can't compete on labor costs then what's what is the industries that's going to um uh absorb Surplus employment so how do we deal with the problem of employment if we're going to move into industries that require less and less labor um and then the second question had is as I understand it from the history of Singapore EDB held a very Premier position as like the head of Singapore's developmental State and lots of the top brass came from EDB like yourself but now as the permanent Minister said with other Industries um taking for um and even places like imda and Mas even playing a developmental role what is the role of EDB today does it still hold that Central developmental role does it have to work with other uh development agencies as well thank you okay great maybe let's start with the first question okay kidnapping and are singaporeans too comfortable you know what we should do is that minist education should arrange for our secondary school kids to send to Cambodia Vietnam do a semester there the kids there are hungry know Singapore kids do not realize you go to Vietnam our Factor now now we have 18 Parts under Sam cour our chman there the V kids are very hungry so the diffic of Singapore G they always look at American model European model holiday Disney World you go to Vietnam they have no Disney World they are struggling when I first set industrial park there they all working very hard uh so the key is that maybe one way for Min education is prly send our students not to America send to our asan neighbors to see how people live there work there do their attachment there uh that's why I suggested to uh because I chair the N Business School uh business school I said want to get all your students going into a a Sting with some of our neighboring countries because our neighborhood is still a big gap with us and our young people they are more hungry and there's no other solution unless the parents uh take take away their pocket money on second question uh Joor Singapore s EZ the political difficulties minister of trade industry uh Li Jing Tong came to see me uh two months ago asking me what I can do with uh Singapore jeor zone so I told him if I were a jeor engineer and you pay me 4,000 R I come to Singapore get $4,000 Singapore dollars you think I will stay in jeor because the Gap is serious so I say really if you are to produce in joall I cannot pay them a Singapore salary unless say you joke with me why not pay them two3 so I say my Singapore engineer is 4,000 uh that convert to uh Malaysian currency about 12,000 regate MH so thean my Joo my P Engineers already paid 5,000 R so I told him it's not possible to do manufacturing there because you need unless it's pure labor assembly if you want to higher value and short labor I say the only industry I can see there is Education Health Care uh retirement homes jokingly services are area because that's the area look even healthare is not a minor thing because the healthare really good doctors nurses so for manufacturing is quite a difficult check okay data centers they now have approved 20 data Cent you know what data center power hungry water hungry and very few workers inside you you go to a data centers all computers all the wi is there you think cool the guy sit down there control station control make sure all the batteries are working the construction data center require workers the moment the constru sector is done the sector running very few jobs I sent an article around to some read you know to build a this Center require construction Engineers but once it's done very few people need it so your has approved more than 20 and they now they realize is oh better increase electricity rates on them right it's a fact because why should we subsidize unless you got Hydro power is cheap like in in Bhutan they tried with cryptocurrency they spend a billion dollars on because they got Hydro power generate this is just Bunch tons and tons of computer running it whether it's uh our friend from Nida chips they basic a computer set that almost like PC and they use a lot of energy and you need to cool you need good uh cooling system there but very few jobs so je my view is that really uh should Singapore hland without political application this make sense if I can live in je in fact I was telling the minister dep Minister once you RTS more of the Y people will will take the train to Singapore to work because our housing cost so high why want to live in Singapore if the train is about 30 minutes it makes more sense for JE people to live there and work here in fact also for Singapore to live there and work here unless hdb cool down the C it's a fact of life because I went to uh Forest City for they are having for 3,000 R per square foot a good quality one that's about only 1,000 s our now our Condominiums here are going for 3,000 square foot Singapore dollars so in Pang is different because Pang because we moved to p a long time my P Engineers are only 5,000 R they not complain because housing there is cheaper affordable but even 5,000 rate with labor type eventually have to go to 6 well 6,000 rate divid by 3 is 2,000 sing my Engineers here cost about 5,000 sing M so the Gap is very high I mean I go to jaw I go to Pang uh my Asma drug is $84 here I buy a pank I actually pay only about4 $32 so Singo you go and buy more drugs from they come from the same Factory they come from the same Factory it's true so I was very honest with him he he knows me quite well because I knew him was young he's not depy Minister D Chong I say if you really going to have Manufacturing in je it be a challenge unless you allow me more foreign workers right that means I got to do more of the labor type if you want a Jo engineer the Jo engineer will not stay there will come to Singapore take the RTS it's a fact of that so I'm being frank to him so uh fortunately he's a politician election he's the MP for that area isanda p is the MP there he won the election few times so he's worried about jobs I say most of Mia are working in Singapore here maybe what the fact we should all live in J and Singapore so maybe third question uh we're moving from uh know to a higher value added economy and so he's asking right what's the industry that's going to absorb all this Surplus employment as you know employment becomes manufacturing employment strength manufacturing employment the last statistic is less than 15% yeah 12% 12% so now most of singur are in services and as you know Serv productivity not very high it's quite tough to cannot auto mechanic and the reality is that we have to depend more domestic market so going forward I think we Chinese for government how to make sure that there's enough jobs for Singapore in the services sector Services as Medical Services Health Care Services uh teaching Services the other non for example in a in a restaurant restaurant business quite tough you see a lot of uh food and beverage company labor is tight cost are high they close so economically going forward is quite a challenge because you're now so dependent on domestic market and then the cost are high so we have a big challenge whoever is MP of the area better worry because it's a fact of life J try if we go to J now more and more traffic jam there to many vehicles going down because they can automate they can upgrade they use real people I eventually take our MTH employment of manufactur maybe down 10% mhm 10% when I was first work manufacturing employment of share manufactur 25 maybe 30 now we're down to 12 50% can even go down to 10% but Engineers more technicians less blue color worker you see if you look at my automated machines big machines the worker doesn't do anything just Program stand on there was a machine it's not and the whole place e ition is not dirty is clean so idea of factories are dirty is not true in fact the floor is spotless clean it's better than hospital because I cannot spill oil and 24 by7 fully aor in a sense it played to our strength because you know our population shrinking but also more educated so the challenge is politically how to find enough job this is not only Singapore you look at automotive industry in Japan in Germany the automotive industry is dependent on mechanical engineering distance engine cylinder transmission gearbox those all gone what is the electric car a golf cart the battery four wheels a motor in fact the EV car either AC DC to AC because motos run better AC one motor behind induction motor one in front the next St they have a motor for every wheel so your car can park sideways but so where are the jobs for more and more country will face a problem because if the EV Frankfurt of course uh sugat will be in trouble Nagoya will be trouble because all the mechanical industry are gone there's no reator in the car now so I can imagine any country that's why China is smart they jump straight to EV because All Electronics that's why electronic industry semiconduct very important in China today the EV car in China is not a car it's an entertainment system so the everything is Music Entertainment everything is there so now they have a new they have a new rare article they lot of graveyard because a lot of new EV car start up the company collapse you got the car but your software is outd you got a car electric car is a basically a computer on Wheels it's not your normal automotive engine right the the challenge is that the electric car is still more expensive than IC but byd have brought the price down to almost as good as 10,000 and they are focusing on share volume so if the electric the key cause of electric car is a battery the batter is coming down faster so a lot of changes China uses uh lithium iron phosphate battery the Western Country use maganese Cobalt different batteries and the Chinese batteries are supposed to be safer unless they switch so you look a key in electrical energ is chemistry semiconductors induction motor ACDC converters are standard and the Key software Entertainment System uh software in fact a good electric car there no to go to Workshop you can all the software downloaded it's just the apple as you update your software so electric car really will change the whole employment big change for us Germany and Japan now the key Advantage people are scared of called range worry range okay uh who has said byd say they aiming for 1,000 kilometers one charge that comes about but really most most of us in cities we don't need 1,000 kilometers from Jong to uh Changi is only about 40 kilm so really we are driving at most we about 100 kilm a day so there's no R for range anxiety but it's all meant for worry so now there's a grab more and more hybrid cars yep that's the only thing so worry them maybe the last question of this group uh does EDB still play a Central Development role that's well I hope so because someone has to bring you the bacon to Singapore uh you see EDB is different from tomasic GIC when you are GIC people come and kiss your hands please invest in me or EDB we have to kiss there it's a tough job and we are competing against I just had a zoom last night my Indonesian friends uh the new uh CIO Chief investment officer of Dan Tera so he asked me to zoom in at 10:00 you want to zoom to 12 say sorry I got 1 hour and they are trying to build up the so Ware fund uh P was fell us internet because I night because myself friends from us from Europe all zooming in to help them you know to me indes you worth chasing they quite Keen so I thought you were we have two Sovereign fund got GIC very different one invest in assets yeah one in equities and so on so trying to learn in fact they're supposed to come next week I say well you I'm free I join you otherwise so I get request for free advice I never charge Chong I didn't charge my Indonesian friends cuz I zoom so I don't have to travel I don't complain but when Chon come see me I'll give my advice so I come to a point I get unpaid give free advice hopefully EDB remains important yeah next round of questions gentlemen here is this okay yeah hi uh thanks Mr y thanks Mr CH uh my name is Ki I'm a I was a biophysicist then I changed to law uh so I'm my question is more technical um uh coning two technologies um one is uh quantum physics uh uh Quantum and the other one is uh nuclear okay so my first uh my first question is concerning Quantum Quantum uh as most technical people would know there is a step up concerning as as opposed to classical uh systems Quantum Computing as opposed to classical Computing so my question is given the different nature want to pick your mind on these questions given the different nature of quantum what kind of business models can we uh build around quantum to leverage on the technology that's one question question two is nuclear uh it seems to me that um my take away from this conversation is that uh Singapore needs uh industries that are very dense high density high value density uh Industries um so I think Quantum and tech and and uh nuclear are two of those Industries my question for for nuclear is this where do you think we can put our nuclear plants uh in Singapore uh given your previous experience uh doing petrochemicals in D Island and uh where can we source for all the all the you know inputs thorium all the different problem deals that's the question two third question is yeah sorry last question last question my my last question is what are your thoughts on the asan power grid thanks okay Quantum nuclear asan power GD someone else yep are are you asking question somebody there okay great oh there's a lady there's a lady there u i I've been Wai with hand for a long time so I'm going to try to grab I'll come to you soon after yeah maybe maybe the lady first since she's been waiting there for a while sorry I missed you hi uh I'm Irene ho I'd like to find out what you think about the problems facing Singapore in the future relating to what's been happening with the the uh Nvidia chips okay what kind of problems uh and it just pointed to me that there's something interesting going on and we are likely to get more of this kind of thing as the uh trading environment gets tougher okay great thank you this gentan thank you so I'm going to sneak in this question uh my name is Andre I'm a I'm a subscriber of your notion that manufacturing is important for the country so my question is on manufacturing if in the 1980s we were known to be cheaper and faster as our value proposition to the world in today's new world right what should Singapore's design principle be and value proposition to the world in manufacturing should we still be cheaper and faster is that still relevant or what should we be uh I think that that is a question thank you thank you maybe one last one this gentleman sir thank you for your sharing my name is uh W2 I've been spending the past 12 years between Singapore and West Joor uh may I have your concurrence that in order for Innovation to happen one has to break existing rules uh I've admired you for your past record in the art of breaking rules without getting into trouble so for the sake of the survival of the future of Singapore in my very non-educated opinion we need to break some rules we need to be more empathetic to Southeast Asia we need to be more multilingual and make more effort [Music] to understand stand and to speak Regional languages so with your very big influence in society and in the system uh what are your suggestions for us singaporeans to be able to go forward and be a step ahead of the competition uh because from my grassroot perspective in Peninsula Malaysia and in Singapore uh I find that the Malaysians are much more humanistic empathetic to close the deal and to make things happen unlike the many young singaporeans I see today thank you thank you okay let's go through questions quite quickly because we have 10 minutes left but maybe just uh command first on Quantum nuclear and then the asan power grid well recently uh Microsoft announced that they got a quantum computer running there's article on my table where the scientific Community disagree it they me claiming so nobody know but I think the AI move faster than Quantum Computing is a fact so a lot of the quantum is China is also work in Computing and they're quite expensive they're using CIT so still this is like uh holy challice of computing Quantum yeah so between AI I think AI can do faster because you can uh you don't have to be S Hardware demanding quum is quite Hardware demanding it's quite expensive yeah you have vied on nuclear your views on nuclear power no nuclear power Abu Dhabi they now going for small nuclear power plants small Nu plants in the sense 100 megawatt 200 megawatt so the future to them is dispersed rather than one big nuc Power Plant of 2,000 megaw and also in the say it's also safer so some countries are experimenting that not many of you are aware in 1970s uh T soon Hing F including myself many us were taking out physics because the Singapore government look at nuclear power in 1970s so I I I I was accepted by any to do physics RAM joh wased for physics H was phys Nuclear Physics uh things but there's no clinical power plant so most are unemployed but now in America nuclear fish is coming back in China they are producing 10 nuclear power plants per year France has 54 nuclear power plants Germany is hot L now so French sell to now the demand for nuclear power plant not the giant ones the small one is coming back so you are smart student nuclear engineering is back business again so what's your view on the viability of the Assan power grid well the aan power PL has been discussing for a long time the key is uh compatibility different systems you need to harmonize and standard so I don't know whether they can achieve that uh we are I think with us and J is possible Indonesia some people talk about to batam but you go to Jakarta not too sure because it's a physical uh constraints we are not one landmarks we are separate by water and every so not so so easy but idea going to small nuclear power plants is a possibility in fact we did in the 70s we look at Tong when I was M maybe put a power plant to come everybody's SC people in ch get fright but today is not the nuclear power plant smaller it's possible so you watch what the people are doing now in in the Middle East some countries doing it Abu Dhabi is doing it smaller ones and also the whole process of the uh the nuclear material being used so it will come but the the cost is high uh you can bring it down so it's at District cooling now can District power why not so whether we are will to experiment maybe we could put a small Nu power plant and our military Camp to go supply all the people in ch okay moving swiftly on next question is on Nvidia you know the recent Nvidia case and also the the fact that we are going to see a lot more export controls for chips yeah so how would that affect Singapore well inidia China constitutes 12% of its Market Revenue so inidia is now caught between the China and us and and although they downgrade the chip to H20 whatever but what is happening that the Chinese are doing their own chips Huawei is doing their own chips Alibaba own ships matter of time and they have the chip design they have smic the semiconductor industry of China so the more the American put a squeeze on China you force them to be independent if they are smart will sell them they can always cut P raise a price what the Chinese are not still people they have enough Engineers so where is fic with Huawei or Alibaba they will do it maybe not the fastest ship that's what de had done so in the reality D depends on China market so in a sense uh so I was told that D chin New Year went all the way to China to talk all the customers please buy my chip right don't forget Nidia is not a new company you've been around for a long time they were doing graphic chips for gamings all the chips for gaming people who sit on the spend hours so that become important in the AIA because it's all either training the chip or the chip so the is doing uh AMD track has not done well uh there are not many other countries I think other company in Nidia that's right yeah but what's the implication for Singapore I think the lady was asking well so far we allowed to buy uh hope hopefully we are some some people are called selling to Malaysia but if our companies can use the H20 or better chips I see no reason why we can't build up uh support the more more training and development it can be done so Singapore is still in the green card we are not on the black Le M uh now America tightening up but you know it makes no sense the more they tighten up the more the Chinese will do it yeah I'm quite sure they would do it I remember when Chi was prime minister I to come to Singapore with ch I said there two key Industries for China One semiconductor and two chemicals so I took to J Island I show you the semiconduct plant now in China has all the petrochemical themselves our petrochemical question semic they do it in fact when I was talking he was PM first was DPM PM I said why do you have 20 province buying the own semiconductor plant all day 20 Micron machines because in China there's no National policy every prob want to be king every prob wants to be a semiconductor King you know China is more competitive than America so 100 EV cars 100 EV cars most of are ding they eventually left how many EV cars are there America Tesla GM Tri uh for tribe and then uh R van D China is very competitive the problem is is a very wasted waste food system because everyone compete many SCS left behind but they will survive so in this in the in the Nida chip n's greatest threat is China not any other company in America not AMD even M next question manufacturing what's our value proposition is it still cheaper better and faster uh well we're no longer cheaper for sure uh the key in high you need talent so we can train now bright smart Singapore are not cheap and they can be productive they are not thank God it's Thursday okay survive that's my view and that's the government think that we should give everybody thank God is Thursday you know thank God is Thursday not a joke know because uh there was reading a report about tsmc TSM started the Factory phix Arizona they say all Taiwanese the American Engineers many they quit this is slave labor they want to have a thank God is thirsday the chines Taiwanese go down now now they got Tai restaurant Chinese school for the kids you know same industry is cap in sensive you need people to can run on shift manage the place on shift not Holiday Camp you know not Disney World but the value system must be there you look at our semiconduct you should visit the guys are working because it has to be run on three shift to four shift there's no such thing as uh we work Friday and then switch off so for Singapore is our course is a challenge uh our biggest challenge is not enough manpower we don't have enough Engineers quality Engineers we are worry so maybe you should go and kidnap some more uh all the principles of Singapore uh secondary school should go around hunting give scholarship to aan neighbor kids what's wrong we can afford four years of secondary education even six years education after that if I still 100 20 St are good enough we don't have enough kids in our schools now know some of schools are closing sh because no more babies so last question of this set right from that gentleman there he talked about breaking rules and whether you know the art of breaking rules right and what are some of the suggestions you have for Singapore to go forward well if we break rules must expect with SE so you are not afraid of being sex then you carry on you are scared of your job no man I work with Dr go how as far concern I can always walk out anytime the fact I don't believe I'm a civil servant I mean I'm not obled to stay walk out so I can do all the things and break provid I Break The Rules not my personal benefit I break the rules for the national gain for the mean they have gain the company I don't see any crime right because end of the day I trying to shortcut I give example when I came back in 76 i S4 Dr go asked me CIS sea Oda was 455 so I took over sa I automative engineering all the tanks were in the workshop there's no space how to work so I look across I saw two BR football field compliments of the British army so I last told the football field not much you he smile at me I didn't say anything at 5:00 call my officer put considered a wi one football field G right W you complain to him he laughes he go talk to I told we said look you don't need two full field to play most of the time football is growing grass so that's how sa became and I do have to pay for rent for the space p still okay uh we only have time for one last question here and I want to give one question to the uh people who are who are zooming in so maybe one question of this gentlemen uh thank you m um lexon from mind um so actually you talked about China you talked about us so I guess in your experience across all those many decades of traveling to these countries what in your view are the enduring comparative advantage of the countries you have been through the US China perhaps even regionally as well what is the comp comparative advantage of the enduring comparative advantage yes advantage of of engineering oh no uh of the various countries the US China whether or not based on your experiences traveling to these countries you feel that at a core this is just something that you know well we look at us and China uh China has a population that is four times five times depend educated population you go to American PHD programs most are not American Kids yeah you go to PhD program you look at MIT CCH most of them are Asians I remember when I was uh in the promoting semiconductors over IC industry Indians and Chinese so if you look at higher education the American kids are not very large number in PhD program it's a fact of life in China they have all the kids are 100% Chinese where they all the same quality but don't know they got lot of universities not all top grade sh numbers you see so it's it's a value system most Chinese student go to America to study engineering n then go to study philosophy and it's a it's a value system they say they are not interested in in politics but really that's the way is if you go to Taiwan many of kids are engineering is a fact of life so you look at America America and China is competing on talent and talent the disadvantage of China is homogeneous only Chinese America technically are smart they can steal for everybody I remember I visited uh uh I went to Toronto to visit Aerospace group there was uh 19 2019 I look at Aerospace know Canada is inter I meet all the engineers there I look at him you are from Iran I say I should know I've been in Iran Iran Engineers so if a country can steal people like America or can Canada they can always supplement replace that thank God people so Advantage America immigration of good value people is available yeah on the other hand China has own population so the strength ultimately is talent and there's no other no equipment you can buy for the same companies what comes is year last question from someone online maybe just to end us off can the Singapore economic story last for another 60 years that my answer is not my problem all right on that note let's give a round of applause thank you Mr Y and Mr Chin we come to the end of today's lecture we would like to hear your views on the event please click our link on the Facebook feed or scan the QR code on the screen to submit your feedback Mr Philip your's second lecture titled transforming Singapore's economy economy through research and development will take place on 27 March details will be on our website and IPS Facebook page we hope to see you then thank you [Applause]

Mr y will be delivering his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation following his lecture Mr yo will take questions from the audience in the Q&A session the Q&A session will be checked by Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information development at the ministry of digital development and information before we begin please allow me to go over some housekeeping rules for the event thank you for joining us today at the auditorium please be reminded to switch your mobile phones to silent mode the lectur is being streamed live on Facebook it will also be recorded and uploaded onto our IPS website and our social media platforms later please subm me your comments and questions at anytime during the lecture through the Facebook comments for audience members here at auditorium today please step up to the mic during the Q&A session to ask your questions we also like to hear your views on the event there will be a link in the feed at the end of the lecture and a QR code which you can scan to submit your feedback director of ips janit deavon will now deliver his opening remarks director [Applause] please welcome everyone Philip yo our Sr norn fellow for this year is s generis that's Latin for Philip you're one kind one and I can do that's very difficult to introduce him so I will tell two stories which I heard from him first many years ago he may not remember the stor the stories are not exactly about him but about his mentor and Guru uh Dr goking s but it tells you a lot about him the first is a story uh both stories involved I think when you were in minda with him in the early years director what was it planning uh I can't remember what it was but anyway um one day at that time um we had pig farms in Singapore and the pig farms were causing u a lot of problems singaporeans were also complainers then and people complained about the smell of pigs but they also wanted to eat pork um and so how to solve this problem so Dr go calls Philip yo at then what 25 years old something like that uh very young man and calls him in and says look I've had an idea why do we get one of these disused super tankers you know buy them cheap put all the pics on the super tankers and sail the boat the ship out to South China Sea so he asked Philip yo to go and research this idea so Philip yo did and a few days later came back and says uh Dr go pigs don't sweat which is why they roll around in the mug you put them on a super tanker in the middle of the ocean they will all die of heat stroke you will have chasu but not pigs so that was the end of that idea another idea Dr go he reads in some magazine about Krill and how Krill contains very high protein and this story calls up again Philip and says there's this story Krill is very cheap actually the fishermen when they catch the Krill when uh they they throw the Krill away so why don't you go and collect all the Krill free of charge we don't have to pay and then we use it to feed the Army which this time around Philip didn't do sufficient research he did as he was told caught the grill and then we ended up and I remember this because I was in the Army at that time this was early' 70s Dr had just come back to defense from Ministry of Finance we had Crill for breakfast Crill for lunch Crill for dinner at the end of one month Phillip went to doct go and says enough you're going to have a revolt on your hands so that was the end of krill I tell these stories because they illustrate like no other story I've heard how our founding fathers were cranks and there is a definition of genius I can't remember who it was who defined genius as that zigzag flash of lightning in the brain and there is nobody who illustrated that more in the political leadership than Dr go um and nobody in the Civil Service who illustrated that more than Philip yo zigzag flash of lightning in the brain not all cranky ideas are accurate or good so you actually need the philipo in the first guys to go and tell the politician sir you're going to get Chu not pigs second idea you also need somebody like Philip yo to try out cranky ideas so this weird combination of the ability to speak truth to power and also willingness to try out crazy things is what produce the Singapore of today right you if you can't if you if you only have people who take the safe way the predictable way we wouldn't have got the Singapore of today now I have not read the remarks that were prepared for me because it's very difficult to capture philipo unless you've known him or worked with him neither of which I've done but certainly I'm old enough to remember the Philip yo who played such a huge seminal role um in the development of Singapore I won't summarize what he has to say um uh except uh to say that um you will hear plenty of evidence of the zigzag flash of lightning that's genius so without Much Ado please Philip thank you so much director ladies and gentlemen without further Ado I would like to invite Mr Philip yo to begin his first lecture titled charting Singapore's economic transformation Mr yo [Applause] please okay let me put out the first slide this slide is important for Singapore and is also for me from 1960 to 65 I was happy in HGI in the library in 6 1966 I went off to Toronto I came back in 70 as an Industrial Engineer so my whole career started from 1970 when I spent my first job other shot one man with finan was Ministry of Defense so I've been working with Ministry defense from 1970 which the same time as skill intensive 1970 to 1994 most people don't know that I was my payroll even was EDB was still in defense from 19 but i mov from EDB 86 1984 and I was always say what's important is that during my 1970 to 94 although was also evv all my work was industry defense industry I produced motor bombs M16 anti aircraft ammunition build warships rebuilt the Skyhawks so all my career has always been industry so very naturally when Singapore got in trouble at an EDB and EDB are continue the same uh economic role you can see the curve they we have to move to more and more uh particular Industries so in a sense if I look at my this calendar here this chart here is from 1970 to 2006 it's always economic so let me go to the next one the faces I think most sing is aware actually we took off only in 1970 the British left Singapore in 19697 and my first job in defense was to create jobs for Singapore is retrenched by the British Army and that's how I end up building up a defense industry to create jobs for sing for so next phase was Capital intensive for which is important that we have to go into more and more uh labor constraint for unemployment to almost full employment by the 1980s and technology which are continue so my whole career is from the 70s to the 1990s to 2000 now where we are today everybody knows that so I won't emphasize on that now this is important chart when I took over EDB 86 I was a b member of Ed 82 to 85 I was a pump sa in defense I was also chairman computer board defense industry so I was there so I realized in EDB in 1986 how can we contribute the GDP of Singapore at that time uh we had about trying to aim for 25% share of GDP which a tough number and at least 20% of employment of Singapore must be industry but today you look at it employment of singap in Industry today is about 12% 15% but our allp put is HS higher our manufacturing sector is hard to keep at 25 because labor constraints to really look at Singapore 15% of our employees of singapor are working for Industries to produce 20% of GDP it's very significant very few singapor are add that most of our industries that are manufacturing are export there is no local market it 85% of economy is Services which is domestic maybe for Logistics or Ship Repair shipping most of industries that we have sample is that we have less than 15% of population in manufacturing we producing 19% to close to 20 depend on the year of the GDP what's interesting to look at the numbers I ask for breakdown Electronics multinational chemicals multinational bom medical multinational you look at the share of the value added very high I look at Precision Engineering transport G these are more local companies the value is low so from this two data you can see that the multinational companies contrib a very large percent of economic sector and also they give jobs to the local Precision Engineering and uh and bi medical General manufacturing so we need to that combination why do we push for manufacturing I remember I had a long dinner Mr with manufacturing I don't depend on my neighbors if I try to sell services to my neighbors they will never buy so what they have done is manufacturing ski for us to get out of Singapore and drct go play a very important part when I came back from Toronto in 1970 my first job was trying to escape the PSC chairman PSC here because they need offer me a job for one month I applied for a job with a company called L Industries L industry like Texas was one of the semiconductor companies that Singapore so my first job offer offer me as a engineer Industrial Engineer with industry the PSC say sorry you can't you go you're bonded so I stay on then I complain uh how about EDB uh you also cannot go because EDB is actually bought for two month so two job offers the industries rejected rejected how about going to the Ministry of Finance I end up in finance for one month after one my complain is not engineering job uh doing budget work oh they're looking for assist engineer and me they have so that's it so I been there all my own free will now what you can see in Singapore that we really mov when I first joined 1970 came back Singapore was making a magnetic CES any of here magnetic memory CS put a wire through that's how we did very low value but create a lot of jobs and Singapore create a lot of jobs so then we going to next so today we are down more balance unlike many countries around Singapore we are not dependent on one sector we we actually grown I explain the share Precision Engineering which makes a lot of key parts for the D drive electronics and semiconductor we still have a semiconductor industry which is important by the way I set up Charter industry chter Semiconductor in 87 and the same year as tsmc unfortunately tsmc at the full support of the government Singapore government says Liv to multinational that's what happened uh energy chemicals are there and you have the Aerospace Aerospace so if we look at Singapore we are more Diversified than Taiwan Taiwan is only one industry semiconductor we are more balanced fi and partly because unlike Taiwan most of the companies we have are multinational in Taiwan most the company are local if I remember years ago when I to Taiwan Taiwan has a tari of 30% Singapore no tari tyan has a sizer population we don't have so in a sense un like Taiwan uh we have to depend on multinational Investments That give us what Dr go call they bring us technology uh they bring us production know how and the most important is management and markets and Dr go is a very key person in in the defense in the economic of EDB uh when I was in uh in defense he was still involved in the defense industry was also created by Him to create jobs for singaporeans most of you are not aware I involved in amation tanks should produce the first cette for the Navy unit 87 uh rebuild a skyw so all this was because to create jobs we have gone through that phase now everybody knows this now our industry because of our population size we have to constantly upgrade there's no way for us to uh take on labor intensive jobs so you look at transformation that way now we have the done everything by multinational and uh in semiconductors we done it but the key industry we had in the early 70s was a semiconductor long before anybody appreciate long before besides own Ship Repair and as far concerned the semiconductor industry has given us very Brad P the same skills are here today we don't produce uh one particular company but we have many more companies here uh this is it we are in chip design We Are W for fabrication we produce all the this year we do assemble test now assemble test is the most labor intensive so we move when I was EDB help encourage them to move to Pang so you see a lot of the assem test in P actually from Singapore same the people there because we use pan as our more of the labor and we focus on upgrade so Singapore and pan has a very unique relationship unfortunately sing J doesn't have the same let me go on to here okay 1985 uh I was still defend froms so uh I was asked by Minister of Finance that time TR industry ton can you be a chairman of skill Development Fund so Al the problem so September 19985 when I still in defense I took a job job of chairman SK fund then I realized economy was really sinking so can you please come over it be halftime in defense halftime from January 86 I say well I try M I give up I just move over remain as a pump defense and ODP full-time in Jan 86 you look at the data here this are first recession remember manufa is a very key component in 1986 the employment is more than 20% of Singapore population at one time was more than 25 but to is gone down it was a big shock to us that's what I did now EDB has never advertised in the whole history from 1961 to 1986 so when I Tred to Market this advertisement with the Wall Street Financial Times the ministry of trade industry says sorry got no budget so I complained my Minister says no budet why not use some of your reserves so I had to dig with own pocket and run this advertisement and this advertisement I went around to see my good friends in America these are all wellknown companies some are still around and they sign off uh and this was the first time we realized we have how to promote Singapore because at that time one the kid problem on 85 recession was our share our cpf was 25% your contribution 25% by the company at 50% cpf you killed all the companies so 85 recession I always believe is self created self-inflicted anyway after a retire from EDB in 2010 some my fellow uh colleagues sign this off for me as my reputation are working anyway it's a joke now our recovery was good we push for more and more high value production especially trying to move away from uh low value added industry of Refinery the services sector we took on three new sector it sector business headquarters uh Medical Services I try to promote to and uh these were the services we try because in manufacturing I can automate I can produce higher productive in Services harder so my rule of time easier to upgrade manufacturing and to provide services unless the services of high value and next was how to diversify the regional market and those are thing let me take the chemical sector Singapore has been a refining Center over 100 years but the value added is very low we produce refined products for gasoline for kerosene that's it and we are selling these products to the region the low value add is very low so the key constraints was how do we uh at create more jobs the only way to create more jobs in the chemical sector is to go down down the Christmas tree go down to more and more products so came idea I I need to go down the petrochemical route I need land and land is not so easy available in Singapore in fact I went to look at Sosa Island and then the tourist was horrified they're going to steal the island by anyway Sosa island is too small but only 400 450 hectares not very big what I wanted was 3,000 hectares very ambitious because my idea if I I have 3,000 Hees I can have at least three petrochemical comp complex I can produce 3 million tons eth every petrochemical complex is one ethine million tons so minimum three but still four or five to create mass at the same time I want the chemic industry to be link to each other so one a produce something goes to B produce go to C so it's integr itself is is almost a full cluster rather than stand load and this idea was to create and most and secondly one on the island where nobody lives I went to Rotterdam I went to Houston I saw all the houses around them every now there's a fire so I said know the only way is to put in my Island so I asked the government for a budget of 7 billion they nearly fainted so usually I thought okay we start with 500 900 eventually today we have 3,200 hectares that's almost 8,000 acres of land is still available but the chemical entry is changing so now we have to look for what else can we do so I'm spending time with some my EDB colleagues what industries can we put in J Island besides the petrochemical complex now this is good example of anyway Skip One now this is how we refine uh you see refining is low value added now we are down to Specialty Chemicals Petr chemical is there so EDB collect are chasing special chemicals more high value lower volume with good prices and they dependent but at the same time what else what else can we do so the big challenge for Singapore is how to keep on moving ahead because the key challenge for us how to remain linked to the world to manufacturing not just service in the region so now we come to what we have now what most of you are not aware when I try to go down to Farmer production we have no land so I asked my EDB colleagues can we reclaim some more land so from near the shipyards in j where called the to area I asked them to help to reclaim and they reclaim about 300 280 hectares so all the farmer Industries all there and they allocated they share the same utility they same all the needs in the sense they already compact if you go to any farmer company in America us is one company here one company there all SC country here is all P to do today we produce eight of the top uh biological drugs in the world we don't own them uh we produce the drugs for all the companies we have no generics generics are India China Thailand we are all propi because the margins are high but it's a industry that we have packed together and we have trained people for the industry every time there's a new drop we hope they bring it to Singapore so today we have a good these are all the companies here all brand names unfortunately we don't have a local names uh these are all International names and these are names you do not see in Taiwan for sure right now in Hong Kong now and we continue to grow we have to continue grow because uh the biomedical industry biological Industries are very most of drugs are for cancer and other uh difficult diseases but on the other hand the value is very high every time there's a new drug we try to bring them to Singapore EDB colleagues and their job bring here why every drug has a patent life of 17 years the first seven years plus is clinical trial and there's no Revenue when the drug is approved by FDA the St is 10 years only so when I bring them to Singapore we give them the support in the tax holiday they got 10 years of pure cream beyond that somebody will do a generics harder to do with cancer drugs but that's it now all those things we have done most of the sing now I'm no longer EDB I spend my time needling them says are you worried so I thought my good I can ask uh Kong to come and worry us yeah Kong do serve as MDB and as you know EDB is is a place where we travel with one suit case you got five shirts and four trousers Monday to Friday no checking luggage you want check luggage you can join another Ministry yeah so our let me just put this way our operating environment has really changed we all read in the news we have a geopolitical we have trade tariffs the tariffs are going serious we might be CAU it tax incentives our tax incentives no longer be useful and just Big Challenge we have to modify but we are lucky we are in a region aan region I always tell my col it's important region that most of us better learn the speak besides manding Bahasa very young people don't understand that because our neighborhood is still uh lots of Malaysia Indonesia combined together can give us about only 300 million competition for talent the biggest challenge for Singapore last year we had only 35,000 babies I said so we need to go and kidnap and when I was Ed I specialize in kidnapping I take young kids from the region Vietnam India China bring them in young bring them young at 15 you can indoctrinate them they grow up to be singaporeans they bring over 21 they will not be singaporeans so if you really want to grow Singapore KET the best and brightest from the region free education Singapore from seary to jc2 then you got a new Singapore ready made right and ai ai is an area where I was just reading an article I sent to a k you know dips it sounds very simple what's happening now is not dpck they apply dips in every industry the key is not AI the key is how to use it depends on the industry whether I can use it in drug development I can use it in manufacturing I can use in banking so the key is that AI will possibly change the biggest difficulty was that AI I also change employment so employment is another area where I really can for example there a doct I say know when you go for X grade you got depend on the X-ray uh technici take a look but lot of the AI can do of the mundan work which means the demand for skill set will change the only industry that safe are medical services are still safe you a doctors you need nurses every other industry whether they accounting auditing all other Str now nobody knows how bad but it will be happening and these are the key risk so for every if I were the Singapore business Federation will be worrying these are the issue that we have to worry uh how are we going to because nobody knows Mr Trump has been Office foress 100 days already and we all in a spin uh last day I was watching the speech uh we call call reciprocal tariff if we put a t 10 % you put 10% so you going to change a LW you know America for example Mexico and Canada all exports to United States is tar free now he want slam 25% he just get a retrie for one month for the automative industry because automated is well integrated between Canada us and Mexico there a lot disruption uncertainty uh I think politically will be a challenge for young uh government because who knows uh where where we are going but key for us is Singapore Singapore has to be prepared we have to look at advantages of each of these sectors what else can we do so in a sense uh looking forward our EDB officers we have to start thinking how how do we navigate the changes now this is I emphasize to my colleagues uh I work a lot with Indonesia uh started B industrial state 1990 by 1992 was Full Employment I moved to Vietnam today Vietnam uh vsip was my project 94 now there are 18 parks in Vietnam by the same participation I started bang Park 1995 96 16 or know today we are in Bangalore chenai Hyderabad Pune and Bombay so I look at Vietnam we have our uh Mark there in India we have a mark indes a mark China is we have W and so we have to look at maybe we can take advantage position Singapore to take advantage of our neighborhood which means we must accept Singapore to get out of comfort of Singapore and go and manage companies there not just sit at home uh waiting for government vouchers now I mention about Talent this is important thing so I was studing uh in ch can you please go and kidnap because America is cutting the ni budget uh my son is a victim there normally for every dollar research you get another 30 cents for supporting a lab uh electricity water so ni cut down to 15% which means you I a professor I Let Go students and Lego it's quite difficulty for them wor they announc that they'll freeze all probation officers anyone in the US government who a probation means a fresh officer your job is gone it should be way you should Tak in the young ones maybe ret return some of the mid Med managers but that's the way it does so many our young PhD students today are job so if I were the Singapore government I go there and kidnap all of them yeah and they it deep s is not just an eight I it's the same way as we apply it throughout I remember when I set Singapore commun system in 1980s applying SCS computer science to all the manufacturing and those days I was using computers many computers in the same way deeps and the similar whether from Alibaba will have great impact on manufacturing and services so I hope our people are churning out I've just read article that China has more than three 300 colleges set up to train people in AI not all succeed but they produce and a day there will be a critical mask that will come up so maybe ask K to come and entertain us now [Applause] thank you so much uh Mr yo for your lecture for those watching the lecture on Facebook please submit your comments and questions through the Facebook comment box for audience members here please step up to the mic to ask your questions may I now invite Mr Chun Kong permanent secretary information and development at the ministry of digital development and information to start the qna session thanks very much thanks Mr y uh I don't think we need the mics Okay so so uh as you can tell Mr y's style is very Breezy and quick and you know because I think he wants to get down to discussing and to having a great debate with you guys so before we start can I just ask set some house rules first I'll keep the questions short I know many people will be will want to make comments uh just make a short comment more importantly questions so that Mr yo can answer uh secondly we try to keep to the content of the speech really on economic strategy there's a lot more that you can ask him later but let's focus on economic strategy transformation and maybe his time at uh EDB uh I'm as as you would know know I had the honor of actually in a sense following in Mr y's footstep in EDB and one of the things I always remember is when I came in there was only one rule that uh was there throughout which is that trolley back rule uh everywhere you go you carry One Trolley back no matter where you go no matter whether it was a twoe trip no whether no matter whether you gone to Davos and you had a brave minus 20° C it was a One Trolley back Rule and we even maintained it to this day I don't know about DB now I imagine it's the case uh not because we no we are holding on to it because I think it's a symbol of what EDB stands for and what Singapore's economic transformation is about right we stay lean we stay mean we always hustling we always hungry and we always chasing and we got to move fast uh maybe you want to explain why is why did you Institute the one back trolley rule well I I will I arrive in New York on a Sunday arrest Monday morning I wake up early breakfast I leave a hotel one back because we are going to several cities if you want to check your luggage goodbye to your luggage because you change planes and then there delay so hang out to your luggage for dear life one lug so the ru is five shirts four pants B that's for guys now how about for women ladies Now ladies have to roll up their dresses and sausages because otherwise you know the ladies not smart they roll dresses and simple and always dress we only one coat there a coat you wear so for lady officers who Trav we have to learn the same way one now it sounds a bit cruel because I can wake up in New York and I go to uh B another Chicago I go to kooko to look at Del's equipment under the car then I fly to San Francisco so I get 26 27 hours Advantage mhm my working hour is 27 hours because I moved from New York by time I reach California 11:00 I actually have 27 so that's a way and the other key reason is that we have no time for laundry you do laundry you lose your laundry so you make sure you got five shirts four pants five underwear for sure and five socks yeah and the lady officer adjust to be fair oh my lady when I first join EDB 86 there only five lady officers surely CH a few of people but 50% of ladies so I think I'm better diversity than Mr Trump yeah we always say that the ladies in EDB are always uh one of a kind because they are the ones to volunteer for all the difficult assignments like like going to Mumbai going to you know China okay great so maybe let's launch off from where you ended because you know we are now in a new phase uh when you join EDB in manufacturing uh you know this you could argue that actually the you know the conditions were very rip for the manufacturing takeoff right uh globalization mnc's were expanding yeah in fact just a factoid for you right when the semic you know semiconductors are being talked about quite a bit right now actually the semiconductor industry was one of the first Industries to Offshore off offshore within less than 10 years 7 eight years from Silicon Valley they offsh short first place they offshot because it was too and you know Mr yo talked about the assembly and testing part of it which was really the low value connecting wires the first place they offshot was actually Hong Kong because back then American workers were paid $2.50 an hour Hong Kong 25 cent therea came Taiwan 19 cents yes and guess where Singapore was yeah third in theow third in line 11 cents and that's really how we started and today is a completely different story right if you think about it sure we are probably the most most expensive you compare Hong Kong doesn't really have a manufacturing industry but no Taiwan shenen of course right we are also land is very expensive but more critically now we have carbon as a constraint not plus you have tariffs you have a retreat from globalization you have even the prospect of us and China uh contest so do you still believe that manufacturing is the way to go and if so what are the areas that Singapore can comp sure well in semiconductor up to Mr Biden's time and Trump's recently Us lost all conductor other than Intel AMD for example I used to know them so their Foundry in Dr Germany to Global foundaries IBM in fish uh fish kill upate New York I used to visit them saw The waer Foundry also to Global foundaries who is global Foundry uh Abu Dhabi so Abu Dhabi MD uh mad asked me Mr you we want to put all these companies together in Singapore we also bu semiconductor your company to create Global foundies I said well if you buy Dron Singapore and fish New York and Singapore what's your plan we want to build a waer fat Foundry in Abu Dhabi obviously I kept quite a laugh see he never succeeded but I warn them that Global Foundry in this business you must continually invest you cannot stop so I joking teased the CEO mad I say semiconductor Foundry is having a fence mistress very expensive to maintain that's what happened you look at uh TSM every year he has to invest fur F from five Micron to four Micron treat so it's a very challenging so either you have the money or you have the skill if you don't have the skill for example uh tsmc set a factory in Now Phoenix Arizona they have to export 500 Taiwanese there engine and don't forget and semiconductor industry is a 24 by7 there's no such thing as a thank God is Thursday which is American culture yeah after the earthquake straight away the Taiwanese engineer went went to fix we visit a semiconductor plant in Taiwan s gone they even have doet trees nearby because you are working on Shi three Shi or four Shi you want to have t is Friday you cannot build manufacturing semiconductor and that's why I'm very optim pessimistic that America was suceed Intel is now for sale uh Brock C is looking at Intel and then Trump squee uh T can you please buy The Foundry of Intel so the company the biggest reason why Intel is in this back position because when Apple came out iPhone in 207 he used Motorola chips intel was not interested then Apple switch to a chip arm chips are one designed by British group there's no uh it phone that use Apple phone that uses Intel chips they stuck at PCS and desktop computer so Intel lost it the key fit of future key fit for Intel failing was 207 they didn't want to produce the chip for the phone was the biggest mistake I thought is small value today in everything that we have in the car electric car your home vir is semiconductor semiconductor is more available to us today than anything else you look at electric car the key is a battery is chemistry the battery is a DC so when you charge the car you must charge DC when the car will have to convert from DC to AC to control the the induction motor that control the wheel the semiconductor chip the energy management is semiconductor that's it so lucky or not semiconductor today so perect so Americans now realize the so every country now in the world are trying to have the old own National semiconductor Japan is trying to do the same so in Singapore as far we concerned if we can find our Niche we can stay that it but we need good Engineers a good engineer we train we need to have I remember when 19 when I got Su to be at my empty I bought him back from New York and I say I want to build 25 wer F he nearly fainted why 25 W for f needs a lot of water electricity is one water water has no substitute electricity I can use diesel can petrol and what have you or wind so 25 wer fat require lots of water so s say yeah we cannot talk to Pub they will never agree so we came up Idea new water new water is actually edb's idea if I cannot get water I have to recycle although s promote you can drink it but don't drink it well the Recycled water is pure no impurities you one more water so that is important for deionized water and semiconductor so energy intensive water intensive so that's why in Singapore now we have a sizable semiconductor we are now B uh number three and we produce a lot of common parts that goes to everywhere most of our chips now go to Automotive EV so most singapor don't know that all the chips that we produce are really we don't do SML test all ship it out we do the components it goes up we have the we do the casting we do the shape the design and then it goes up but the thing that most Singapore don't see a because it's all in jurong they only know AER Road they know uh so Singapore do not know that out in j under DTC that's where the export of Singapore is that's where the job is and don't forget the multinationals make a lot of money they keep the money in Singapore Banks that's something but not that's why the doctor created the US dollar because all the mountain at one time G motor was here I remember they oh Mr we have about 500 million dollar Us in Singapore why Singapore is safe place they make their money get tax H they keep their money here everybody is happy yeah but you know so that's really I mean kudos to you and the team right you've really created some engines of growth right you have Electronics you have chemicals and bio Biomat but if you you know if I when I was at EDB if I get a penny for every time someone ask me so what's the industry of the future actually my answer I have no answer yeah maybe you have an answer for us so what do you think as you you know now yeah we should be focusing on what industries should well any day you have to make a product but more and more of the product requires much more software so even if I do a electric car the battery indu the ACDC converter the induction motor I still need the software to do the chip management so it's not just Hardware alone so we even really want to build you need to build more and more software people because a lot of the systems have become it's just like using uh dips does the uh the training of the chip buying all your data but the key is inference in in in the AI chip is you train with a database Ste people's information but then you have to use it to infer so the inference challenge is there so in the same way Singapore must find way to do the inference job uh and basically know how the key constraint to software is Talent is people intensive so unless we get uh population increased by more than 35,000 babies I have a choice I like to recruit another 10,000 50,000 kidnapping everybody here because the software is is good intensive we can't survive just on own 35,000 babies makes no sense uh if I were in the government I say I going kidnap or K I was with in Hanoi uh was we when Mr was sick and myself and him and and his s so and we he gave us talk to all the Communist leaders of vet government they asked him to give a talk after a talk uh and then we had dinner with the all the Deputy Prime Ministers and one Mr Lee Phio steals our people because I brought in 500 50 kids from Vietnam SE three I PID for all the SE three to jc2 but one condition every student that comes to sing Under My scholarship AA must a and every subject so they thought J I say well I using my money and you are smart kids there no reason why you cannot get a and have a good life and to prove the point the first batch brought 100 I sent 10 of them back they message got true so compare the Ministry of Education I'm a harder guy because my believe if you know to balance your time you can work hard and still have a life no excuse and they all did well so so the vietnames came here uh students from India China all they came here it well I interview one girl uh father is a farmer in scai or Cai every morning she wakes up at 5:00 4:00 take the school bus pick up M around they collect different kids they reach Singapore School 7:00 from b 1 to a Lev every year perfect score why not so I give a scholarship bachor PhD now Singapore I need to K more of those kids I went to Penang uh chief minister L Waring Please Don't Steal My People so he he had a big ceremony said Philip I got one boy and one girl the highest students with a level malan a Lev so there and there I offer a scholarship one of the boys the girl the father want to S the us so I took the boy it came to Singapore do physics and us I subsidized the schy to one of my companies so if I were running government kidnapping is a key function so if I were to follow up on this and ask you a more sensitive question so if I'm a young Singaporean I'll be very worried now because there be so much competition all this kidnapping of people now what do you say to the young Singaporean you see well uh K my good friend my son's complain you bring all the Vietnamese kids and our JC give me a hard time why they hungry why can't Singapore kids compete with them you know they very kids come here they stay in the doet Tre I put n High all so yeah from Monday through Friday in school Saturday Sunday stay in the D studying if Singapore cannot compete it's their fault I mean ultimately because these kids are really hungry my first patch I first took in in SGI International the first patch I have to sell 208 206 so I gave away the first IB certificate to 54 of them who was the top student my Vietnamese scholar all eight subject five prizes he came to Singapore the first year could not speak English in fact I remember I brought Tama to meet us so Tama asked the girl say the first year I was crying every day but they learn the key factor that drive these people is hunger if Singapore kids are not hunger good luck to them I don't mean a very good politician so if you were a young student because there are a couple of them in our mid today yeah what would be your advice for them in terms of what to study you know you talk about AI right AI is going to take our jobs right so what would you advise them to do well lucky or not it's easier to study a heart science or engineering and can always learn soft subjects as engineer I can read philosophy I can read economics I can read history not the other way around so by right you have a certain core of in fact some us universities got this liberal study they're not liberal they got science engineering and they have human build around it we are pure Humanities unless you become a journalist or writer stuff so in a sense you like it or not you have to take some good maths physics uh chemistry and then you can do the soft subject so really we look education is good to have a hard and soft combination uh purely sof I don't see how the guy who has a heart science can always pick up softw subjects so if education system we should have fundamentals of math physics in America for medical students because they have do a bachelor degree to apply to medical school they must have physics you don't have physics you cannot do engineering you don't have mathematics you cannot do so basic is mathematics and physics chemistry you can learn biology can read uh philosophy can read too so lucky or not the education must have core of hard core in the center and a soft so you want the all arounded person a person who got philosophy history but you need the good Sciences so an educ system that is purely liberal all the way I don't know how it going to survive MH and in Harvard bus school I was there we have three C of students in our class I was there in 7476 35% are Engineers a business school another 30% are business studies and undergraduate and other remainder are the philosophers boys so when it come to do number crunching the poor liberal arts English guys are lost it's not their fault because like you're not in the business school you have to crunch numbers you got to do projection and financial analysis so when I get anyn report like this I can read very fast I look at the numbers and then say where the compan is going for them they look at where where's the Poetry where's so we used to dist our Li and we used to sit down and help them because when it come to writing they're very good so I ask can they help write the case studies for us so you need a combination of the three groups of people people who are numerical people are also literal and hopefully a Balan education so a good education system must have hard and soft subjects so if I were you I would take a hard one because easier to learn soft subjects why it's hard to do the so a good maths uh good physics are fundamental and I remember I met some people were you know scientists and what's a PhD astronomy so I said why do you study astronomy because the brain is very difficult there are many neurons it's almost like a Galaxy so lucky or not many of neuroscientists are physicists definitely not uh poets for sure so you've you know in your presentation actually what you charted was really extraordinary story and it seems like it's only the Highlight VI right everything is a success but surely there are ones that Got Away surely there are some mistakes surely some regrets maybe can I ask you to share with the audience what are some of the things that you look back and say oh I shouldn't have done this well the the most difficult uh challenge for me when I was is I just have enough manpower there are more projects I want to do and secondly is my cost land cost labor cost so in EDB I have to be selected what are the industries I can bring here what I have to foro so therefore I came the idea maybe I can move some of these companies I cannot attract to my neighborhood so at least I can service them I can also Supply part so when I start that bottom industrial part the reason very simple I came J 86 by 1987 full employment the government slam me a worker a levy quarter so so I got a company at Thomson electronic we are making components uh devices for the TV but now your labor C okay okay produ the components I ship the bottom to sample that's how I surviv so Thompson Electronics surviv because as simply you know there's no better instrument than the eyes in text so the S test is very L int I went to sum electric they make all the wire HS for the automotive cars they ask me for 500 workers I say in Singapore 500 workers to do Automotive top so I mve the bottom so I took 250 Indonesian kids 12 years 18 18 years old 21 send him to Japan for 6 months second back for two months by the way they went to Japan with a Japanese government's approval on my letter of of such requests indan Minister could not get his authority I wrote to the minister of of Labor in Japan I need this worker to be train so tomorrow will to train them take care them 500 and they produce all the assembly so Singapore can never go to the assembly but the part and comp but time come to Singapore port from Singapore over the world so we still get services so what people don't realize botom depends on Singapore right not the other way around so there are industries that I really cannot do if I go to Pang now I have a factory down my Aerospace but is not having labor problem we produce parts for air bus and boing we have 1,700 workers there and still in manufacturing uh they labor tight so now now also had to bring in foreign workers and P same problem as us so now I create a new Factory in uh aaya and chur last year November I was in churri to create two more companies to take some of the work from Pang today so now I have 400 workers in in Thailand by 2026 when a new Factory is up I should have a th workers in Thailand so are there any industries that you regret any companies Industries they regret bringing or they thought well I shouldn't have brought them in well we try every industry except uh Casino by the way I was nearly involved with that lucky uh because you know even you asked to do Services what services can we do so one of the thing was uh tourism I live to tourism uh Financial Ms Logistics we can do it Casino was also China was be I remember we also went to Disney World try to get Disney to do a Disneyland here they ask 1,000 hectares I don't have 1,000 hectares so so many of this uh projects are quite challenging because land and labor so I would say in Singapore the resource constraint of Labor is a key constraint there's no sub that's why we must always push to higher value higher uh value added uh more automation you look our factories in Singapore J well automated we have only l in fact the last statistic I check was 12% of our labor force are in manufacturing and we produce a respectable 19 to 10% % of GDP most young oppon are not aware of that Hong Kong manufacturing share GDP 1% not many peopleware they have no M because all went to C Hong Kong is none so two months ago some friends from Hong Kong can you see me we're taking a set of Advisory board can you come and help us because they used to love a Singapore you all manfa what you do manufacturing their labor no manufacturing depends which part of the value chck what is Trum now trying to do just to try to kill the 54 uh ship act says look tsmc is going to come here because I use tariff there's no need to give money so America now is desperately trying to get manufacturing back that's get back but the key is that if they all Americans are thank God is Thursday not Friday you cannot have manufacturing if my industry is highly automated highly dependent on big machines the most important person for running machine besides the worker who's programming it and then repair maintenance people if the machine breaks down I'm dead so instead of buy one uh DMG machine which is a million dollars I buy three because the key problem of automation is maintenance Personnel the guy repairs a machine machines all break down no Machine Works forever so you need good Engineers you good maintenance people that's why in Singapore we are smart to have poly Technic people you you know when the machine breaks down they you are stuck especially in the industry that is high value High added Capital intensive you cannot afford to shut down so whenever I look at our factories in plan I always worry you are now technician to repair because the machines will break down and the machines cost a lot of money a million dollars in fact we bought six new machines for a factoring plan the machines didn't work they fly technicians from Germany spend months fixing it and I told my people don't pay the Germans ask them to fix it first finally work but show you you buy more Capital Equipment more maintenance if you buy electric car when a car doesn't work you have to run to Workshop Electronics gu is there so the more automated you are the more D you are the more dependent on repair people it literate and so therefore like it or not the skill set of young in a PO te are very important if you go to the hospital now all the MRI machines all the CT scans all run by young people and they all poly people they are obviously not philosophers they are poliy keeping the machines going so if you look at Medical Services go to the hospital I see a shma equipment you need good technicians good Engineers uh besides doctors in fact the doctor is one of two guys the rest of the hospital is the cost of Hospital bit now is $1 million one hosital B $1 million and when the machine doesn't work and you have a problem maybe we open up the floor to questions yeah yep uh we'll take a two or three questions at a goal and then you know we'll answer okay U maybe there first and then uh this gentleman there yeah no I think we have a question up up there right hi this is aliser here right at the back thank you so much for sharing the question I have is that just now as we hear about kidnapping all those around the region and singaporeans getting too comfortable waiting for vouchers only what do you think is the fate of singaporeans do you think that because we have been too comfortable with the policies government being very efficient that we are not adventurers to venture around outside of Singapore too tight back here to the BTO and we need to just go through the whole system in life what do you think will happen to singapor if we continue to be that way and what do you think we can do okay thank you one more question maybe this gentlemen yeah uh my name is Satya I am from a bank called SMBC uh Mr yo uh before I ask my question your advice on one bag is particularly relevant today postco because so many bags get lost uh my question is uh with regard to Johor Singapore sez you know I was particularly interested in the early part where you talked about how we are not dependent on services in the region but now it's obviously much more important to work in the region to grow economic output uh and Johor and and the Malaysian relationship is obviously uh has been a tenuous one um so from the economic growth point of view uh how do you think uh Singapore can make jss EZ a successful economic multiplier for Singapore okay thank you got it okay maybe one more question and then yeah uh that oh sorry that the gentleman there yeah and then just just hold on for the next round yeah hi um just two very short questions um one about if Singapore is going to move into more high value added sectors because it can't compete on labor costs then what's what is the industries that's going to um uh absorb Surplus employment so how do we deal with the problem of employment if we're going to move into industries that require less and less labor um and then the second question had is as I understand it from the history of Singapore EDB held a very Premier position as like the head of Singapore's developmental State and lots of the top brass came from EDB like yourself but now as the permanent Minister said with other Industries um taking for um and even places like imda and Mas even playing a developmental role what is the role of EDB today does it still hold that Central developmental role does it have to work with other uh development agencies as well thank you okay great maybe let's start with the first question okay kidnapping and are singaporeans too comfortable you know what we should do is that minist education should arrange for our secondary school kids to send to Cambodia Vietnam do a semester there the kids there are hungry know Singapore kids do not realize you go to Vietnam our Factor now now we have 18 Parts under Sam cour our chman there the V kids are very hungry so the diffic of Singapore G they always look at American model European model holiday Disney World you go to Vietnam they have no Disney World they are struggling when I first set industrial park there they all working very hard uh so the key is that maybe one way for Min education is prly send our students not to America send to our asan neighbors to see how people live there work there do their attachment there uh that's why I suggested to uh because I chair the N Business School uh business school I said want to get all your students going into a a Sting with some of our neighboring countries because our neighborhood is still a big gap with us and our young people they are more hungry and there's no other solution unless the parents uh take take away their pocket money on second question uh Joor Singapore s EZ the political difficulties minister of trade industry uh Li Jing Tong came to see me uh two months ago asking me what I can do with uh Singapore jeor zone so I told him if I were a jeor engineer and you pay me 4,000 R I come to Singapore get $4,000 Singapore dollars you think I will stay in jeor because the Gap is serious so I say really if you are to produce in joall I cannot pay them a Singapore salary unless say you joke with me why not pay them two3 so I say my Singapore engineer is 4,000 uh that convert to uh Malaysian currency about 12,000 regate MH so thean my Joo my P Engineers already paid 5,000 R so I told him it's not possible to do manufacturing there because you need unless it's pure labor assembly if you want to higher value and short labor I say the only industry I can see there is Education Health Care uh retirement homes jokingly services are area because that's the area look even healthare is not a minor thing because the healthare really good doctors nurses so for manufacturing is quite a difficult check okay data centers they now have approved 20 data Cent you know what data center power hungry water hungry and very few workers inside you you go to a data centers all computers all the wi is there you think cool the guy sit down there control station control make sure all the batteries are working the construction data center require workers the moment the constru sector is done the sector running very few jobs I sent an article around to some read you know to build a this Center require construction Engineers but once it's done very few people need it so your has approved more than 20 and they now they realize is oh better increase electricity rates on them right it's a fact because why should we subsidize unless you got Hydro power is cheap like in in Bhutan they tried with cryptocurrency they spend a billion dollars on because they got Hydro power generate this is just Bunch tons and tons of computer running it whether it's uh our friend from Nida chips they basic a computer set that almost like PC and they use a lot of energy and you need to cool you need good uh cooling system there but very few jobs so je my view is that really uh should Singapore hland without political application this make sense if I can live in je in fact I was telling the minister dep Minister once you RTS more of the Y people will will take the train to Singapore to work because our housing cost so high why want to live in Singapore if the train is about 30 minutes it makes more sense for JE people to live there and work here in fact also for Singapore to live there and work here unless hdb cool down the C it's a fact of life because I went to uh Forest City for they are having for 3,000 R per square foot a good quality one that's about only 1,000 s our now our Condominiums here are going for 3,000 square foot Singapore dollars so in Pang is different because Pang because we moved to p a long time my P Engineers are only 5,000 R they not complain because housing there is cheaper affordable but even 5,000 rate with labor type eventually have to go to 6 well 6,000 rate divid by 3 is 2,000 sing my Engineers here cost about 5,000 sing M so the Gap is very high I mean I go to jaw I go to Pang uh my Asma drug is $84 here I buy a pank I actually pay only about4 $32 so Singo you go and buy more drugs from they come from the same Factory they come from the same Factory it's true so I was very honest with him he he knows me quite well because I knew him was young he's not depy Minister D Chong I say if you really going to have Manufacturing in je it be a challenge unless you allow me more foreign workers right that means I got to do more of the labor type if you want a Jo engineer the Jo engineer will not stay there will come to Singapore take the RTS it's a fact of that so I'm being frank to him so uh fortunately he's a politician election he's the MP for that area isanda p is the MP there he won the election few times so he's worried about jobs I say most of Mia are working in Singapore here maybe what the fact we should all live in J and Singapore so maybe third question uh we're moving from uh know to a higher value added economy and so he's asking right what's the industry that's going to absorb all this Surplus employment as you know employment becomes manufacturing employment strength manufacturing employment the last statistic is less than 15% yeah 12% 12% so now most of singur are in services and as you know Serv productivity not very high it's quite tough to cannot auto mechanic and the reality is that we have to depend more domestic market so going forward I think we Chinese for government how to make sure that there's enough jobs for Singapore in the services sector Services as Medical Services Health Care Services uh teaching Services the other non for example in a in a restaurant restaurant business quite tough you see a lot of uh food and beverage company labor is tight cost are high they close so economically going forward is quite a challenge because you're now so dependent on domestic market and then the cost are high so we have a big challenge whoever is MP of the area better worry because it's a fact of life J try if we go to J now more and more traffic jam there to many vehicles going down because they can automate they can upgrade they use real people I eventually take our MTH employment of manufactur maybe down 10% mhm 10% when I was first work manufacturing employment of share manufactur 25 maybe 30 now we're down to 12 50% can even go down to 10% but Engineers more technicians less blue color worker you see if you look at my automated machines big machines the worker doesn't do anything just Program stand on there was a machine it's not and the whole place e ition is not dirty is clean so idea of factories are dirty is not true in fact the floor is spotless clean it's better than hospital because I cannot spill oil and 24 by7 fully aor in a sense it played to our strength because you know our population shrinking but also more educated so the challenge is politically how to find enough job this is not only Singapore you look at automotive industry in Japan in Germany the automotive industry is dependent on mechanical engineering distance engine cylinder transmission gearbox those all gone what is the electric car a golf cart the battery four wheels a motor in fact the EV car either AC DC to AC because motos run better AC one motor behind induction motor one in front the next St they have a motor for every wheel so your car can park sideways but so where are the jobs for more and more country will face a problem because if the EV Frankfurt of course uh sugat will be in trouble Nagoya will be trouble because all the mechanical industry are gone there's no reator in the car now so I can imagine any country that's why China is smart they jump straight to EV because All Electronics that's why electronic industry semiconduct very important in China today the EV car in China is not a car it's an entertainment system so the everything is Music Entertainment everything is there so now they have a new they have a new rare article they lot of graveyard because a lot of new EV car start up the company collapse you got the car but your software is outd you got a car electric car is a basically a computer on Wheels it's not your normal automotive engine right the the challenge is that the electric car is still more expensive than IC but byd have brought the price down to almost as good as 10,000 and they are focusing on share volume so if the electric the key cause of electric car is a battery the batter is coming down faster so a lot of changes China uses uh lithium iron phosphate battery the Western Country use maganese Cobalt different batteries and the Chinese batteries are supposed to be safer unless they switch so you look a key in electrical energ is chemistry semiconductors induction motor ACDC converters are standard and the Key software Entertainment System uh software in fact a good electric car there no to go to Workshop you can all the software downloaded it's just the apple as you update your software so electric car really will change the whole employment big change for us Germany and Japan now the key Advantage people are scared of called range worry range okay uh who has said byd say they aiming for 1,000 kilometers one charge that comes about but really most most of us in cities we don't need 1,000 kilometers from Jong to uh Changi is only about 40 kilm so really we are driving at most we about 100 kilm a day so there's no R for range anxiety but it's all meant for worry so now there's a grab more and more hybrid cars yep that's the only thing so worry them maybe the last question of this group uh does EDB still play a Central Development role that's well I hope so because someone has to bring you the bacon to Singapore uh you see EDB is different from tomasic GIC when you are GIC people come and kiss your hands please invest in me or EDB we have to kiss there it's a tough job and we are competing against I just had a zoom last night my Indonesian friends uh the new uh CIO Chief investment officer of Dan Tera so he asked me to zoom in at 10:00 you want to zoom to 12 say sorry I got 1 hour and they are trying to build up the so Ware fund uh P was fell us internet because I night because myself friends from us from Europe all zooming in to help them you know to me indes you worth chasing they quite Keen so I thought you were we have two Sovereign fund got GIC very different one invest in assets yeah one in equities and so on so trying to learn in fact they're supposed to come next week I say well you I'm free I join you otherwise so I get request for free advice I never charge Chong I didn't charge my Indonesian friends cuz I zoom so I don't have to travel I don't complain but when Chon come see me I'll give my advice so I come to a point I get unpaid give free advice hopefully EDB remains important yeah next round of questions gentlemen here is this okay yeah hi uh thanks Mr y thanks Mr CH uh my name is Ki I'm a I was a biophysicist then I changed to law uh so I'm my question is more technical um uh coning two technologies um one is uh quantum physics uh uh Quantum and the other one is uh nuclear okay so my first uh my first question is concerning Quantum Quantum uh as most technical people would know there is a step up concerning as as opposed to classical uh systems Quantum Computing as opposed to classical Computing so my question is given the different nature want to pick your mind on these questions given the different nature of quantum what kind of business models can we uh build around quantum to leverage on the technology that's one question question two is nuclear uh it seems to me that um my take away from this conversation is that uh Singapore needs uh industries that are very dense high density high value density uh Industries um so I think Quantum and tech and and uh nuclear are two of those Industries my question for for nuclear is this where do you think we can put our nuclear plants uh in Singapore uh given your previous experience uh doing petrochemicals in D Island and uh where can we source for all the all the you know inputs thorium all the different problem deals that's the question two third question is yeah sorry last question last question my my last question is what are your thoughts on the asan power grid thanks okay Quantum nuclear asan power GD someone else yep are are you asking question somebody there okay great oh there's a lady there's a lady there u i I've been Wai with hand for a long time so I'm going to try to grab I'll come to you soon after yeah maybe maybe the lady first since she's been waiting there for a while sorry I missed you hi uh I'm Irene ho I'd like to find out what you think about the problems facing Singapore in the future relating to what's been happening with the the uh Nvidia chips okay what kind of problems uh and it just pointed to me that there's something interesting going on and we are likely to get more of this kind of thing as the uh trading environment gets tougher okay great thank you this gentan thank you so I'm going to sneak in this question uh my name is Andre I'm a I'm a subscriber of your notion that manufacturing is important for the country so my question is on manufacturing if in the 1980s we were known to be cheaper and faster as our value proposition to the world in today's new world right what should Singapore's design principle be and value proposition to the world in manufacturing should we still be cheaper and faster is that still relevant or what should we be uh I think that that is a question thank you thank you maybe one last one this gentleman sir thank you for your sharing my name is uh W2 I've been spending the past 12 years between Singapore and West Joor uh may I have your concurrence that in order for Innovation to happen one has to break existing rules uh I've admired you for your past record in the art of breaking rules without getting into trouble so for the sake of the survival of the future of Singapore in my very non-educated opinion we need to break some rules we need to be more empathetic to Southeast Asia we need to be more multilingual and make more effort [Music] to understand stand and to speak Regional languages so with your very big influence in society and in the system uh what are your suggestions for us singaporeans to be able to go forward and be a step ahead of the competition uh because from my grassroot perspective in Peninsula Malaysia and in Singapore uh I find that the Malaysians are much more humanistic empathetic to close the deal and to make things happen unlike the many young singaporeans I see today thank you thank you okay let's go through questions quite quickly because we have 10 minutes left but maybe just uh command first on Quantum nuclear and then the asan power grid well recently uh Microsoft announced that they got a quantum computer running there's article on my table where the scientific Community disagree it they me claiming so nobody know but I think the AI move faster than Quantum Computing is a fact so a lot of the quantum is China is also work in Computing and they're quite expensive they're using CIT so still this is like uh holy challice of computing Quantum yeah so between AI I think AI can do faster because you can uh you don't have to be S Hardware demanding quum is quite Hardware demanding it's quite expensive yeah you have vied on nuclear your views on nuclear power no nuclear power Abu Dhabi they now going for small nuclear power plants small Nu plants in the sense 100 megawatt 200 megawatt so the future to them is dispersed rather than one big nuc Power Plant of 2,000 megaw and also in the say it's also safer so some countries are experimenting that not many of you are aware in 1970s uh T soon Hing F including myself many us were taking out physics because the Singapore government look at nuclear power in 1970s so I I I I was accepted by any to do physics RAM joh wased for physics H was phys Nuclear Physics uh things but there's no clinical power plant so most are unemployed but now in America nuclear fish is coming back in China they are producing 10 nuclear power plants per year France has 54 nuclear power plants Germany is hot L now so French sell to now the demand for nuclear power plant not the giant ones the small one is coming back so you are smart student nuclear engineering is back business again so what's your view on the viability of the Assan power grid well the aan power PL has been discussing for a long time the key is uh compatibility different systems you need to harmonize and standard so I don't know whether they can achieve that uh we are I think with us and J is possible Indonesia some people talk about to batam but you go to Jakarta not too sure because it's a physical uh constraints we are not one landmarks we are separate by water and every so not so so easy but idea going to small nuclear power plants is a possibility in fact we did in the 70s we look at Tong when I was M maybe put a power plant to come everybody's SC people in ch get fright but today is not the nuclear power plant smaller it's possible so you watch what the people are doing now in in the Middle East some countries doing it Abu Dhabi is doing it smaller ones and also the whole process of the uh the nuclear material being used so it will come but the the cost is high uh you can bring it down so it's at District cooling now can District power why not so whether we are will to experiment maybe we could put a small Nu power plant and our military Camp to go supply all the people in ch okay moving swiftly on next question is on Nvidia you know the recent Nvidia case and also the the fact that we are going to see a lot more export controls for chips yeah so how would that affect Singapore well inidia China constitutes 12% of its Market Revenue so inidia is now caught between the China and us and and although they downgrade the chip to H20 whatever but what is happening that the Chinese are doing their own chips Huawei is doing their own chips Alibaba own ships matter of time and they have the chip design they have smic the semiconductor industry of China so the more the American put a squeeze on China you force them to be independent if they are smart will sell them they can always cut P raise a price what the Chinese are not still people they have enough Engineers so where is fic with Huawei or Alibaba they will do it maybe not the fastest ship that's what de had done so in the reality D depends on China market so in a sense uh so I was told that D chin New Year went all the way to China to talk all the customers please buy my chip right don't forget Nidia is not a new company you've been around for a long time they were doing graphic chips for gamings all the chips for gaming people who sit on the spend hours so that become important in the AIA because it's all either training the chip or the chip so the is doing uh AMD track has not done well uh there are not many other countries I think other company in Nidia that's right yeah but what's the implication for Singapore I think the lady was asking well so far we allowed to buy uh hope hopefully we are some some people are called selling to Malaysia but if our companies can use the H20 or better chips I see no reason why we can't build up uh support the more more training and development it can be done so Singapore is still in the green card we are not on the black Le M uh now America tightening up but you know it makes no sense the more they tighten up the more the Chinese will do it yeah I'm quite sure they would do it I remember when Chi was prime minister I to come to Singapore with ch I said there two key Industries for China One semiconductor and two chemicals so I took to J Island I show you the semiconduct plant now in China has all the petrochemical themselves our petrochemical question semic they do it in fact when I was talking he was PM first was DPM PM I said why do you have 20 province buying the own semiconductor plant all day 20 Micron machines because in China there's no National policy every prob want to be king every prob wants to be a semiconductor King you know China is more competitive than America so 100 EV cars 100 EV cars most of are ding they eventually left how many EV cars are there America Tesla GM Tri uh for tribe and then uh R van D China is very competitive the problem is is a very wasted waste food system because everyone compete many SCS left behind but they will survive so in this in the in the Nida chip n's greatest threat is China not any other company in America not AMD even M next question manufacturing what's our value proposition is it still cheaper better and faster uh well we're no longer cheaper for sure uh the key in high you need talent so we can train now bright smart Singapore are not cheap and they can be productive they are not thank God it's Thursday okay survive that's my view and that's the government think that we should give everybody thank God is Thursday you know thank God is Thursday not a joke know because uh there was reading a report about tsmc TSM started the Factory phix Arizona they say all Taiwanese the American Engineers many they quit this is slave labor they want to have a thank God is thirsday the chines Taiwanese go down now now they got Tai restaurant Chinese school for the kids you know same industry is cap in sensive you need people to can run on shift manage the place on shift not Holiday Camp you know not Disney World but the value system must be there you look at our semiconduct you should visit the guys are working because it has to be run on three shift to four shift there's no such thing as uh we work Friday and then switch off so for Singapore is our course is a challenge uh our biggest challenge is not enough manpower we don't have enough Engineers quality Engineers we are worry so maybe you should go and kidnap some more uh all the principles of Singapore uh secondary school should go around hunting give scholarship to aan neighbor kids what's wrong we can afford four years of secondary education even six years education after that if I still 100 20 St are good enough we don't have enough kids in our schools now know some of schools are closing sh because no more babies so last question of this set right from that gentleman there he talked about breaking rules and whether you know the art of breaking rules right and what are some of the suggestions you have for Singapore to go forward well if we break rules must expect with SE so you are not afraid of being sex then you carry on you are scared of your job no man I work with Dr go how as far concern I can always walk out anytime the fact I don't believe I'm a civil servant I mean I'm not obled to stay walk out so I can do all the things and break provid I Break The Rules not my personal benefit I break the rules for the national gain for the mean they have gain the company I don't see any crime right because end of the day I trying to shortcut I give example when I came back in 76 i S4 Dr go asked me CIS sea Oda was 455 so I took over sa I automative engineering all the tanks were in the workshop there's no space how to work so I look across I saw two BR football field compliments of the British army so I last told the football field not much you he smile at me I didn't say anything at 5:00 call my officer put considered a wi one football field G right W you complain to him he laughes he go talk to I told we said look you don't need two full field to play most of the time football is growing grass so that's how sa became and I do have to pay for rent for the space p still okay uh we only have time for one last question here and I want to give one question to the uh people who are who are zooming in so maybe one question of this gentlemen uh thank you m um lexon from mind um so actually you talked about China you talked about us so I guess in your experience across all those many decades of traveling to these countries what in your view are the enduring comparative advantage of the countries you have been through the US China perhaps even regionally as well what is the comp comparative advantage of the enduring comparative advantage yes advantage of of engineering oh no uh of the various countries the US China whether or not based on your experiences traveling to these countries you feel that at a core this is just something that you know well we look at us and China uh China has a population that is four times five times depend educated population you go to American PHD programs most are not American Kids yeah you go to PhD program you look at MIT CCH most of them are Asians I remember when I was uh in the promoting semiconductors over IC industry Indians and Chinese so if you look at higher education the American kids are not very large number in PhD program it's a fact of life in China they have all the kids are 100% Chinese where they all the same quality but don't know they got lot of universities not all top grade sh numbers you see so it's it's a value system most Chinese student go to America to study engineering n then go to study philosophy and it's a it's a value system they say they are not interested in in politics but really that's the way is if you go to Taiwan many of kids are engineering is a fact of life so you look at America America and China is competing on talent and talent the disadvantage of China is homogeneous only Chinese America technically are smart they can steal for everybody I remember I visited uh uh I went to Toronto to visit Aerospace group there was uh 19 2019 I look at Aerospace know Canada is inter I meet all the engineers there I look at him you are from Iran I say I should know I've been in Iran Iran Engineers so if a country can steal people like America or can Canada they can always supplement replace that thank God people so Advantage America immigration of good value people is available yeah on the other hand China has own population so the strength ultimately is talent and there's no other no equipment you can buy for the same companies what comes is year last question from someone online maybe just to end us off can the Singapore economic story last for another 60 years that my answer is not my problem all right on that note let's give a round of applause thank you Mr Y and Mr Chin we come to the end of today's lecture we would like to hear your views on the event please click our link on the Facebook feed or scan the QR code on the screen to submit your feedback Mr Philip your's second lecture titled transforming Singapore's economy economy through research and development will take place on 27 March details will be on our website and IPS Facebook page we hope to see you then thank you [Applause]
